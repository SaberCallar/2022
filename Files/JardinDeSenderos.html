			<p>In his <i>A History of the World War</i> (page 212), Captain Liddell Hart reports that a 
planned offensive by thirteen British divisions, supported by fourteen hundred 
artillery pieces, against the German line at <span class="place">Serre-Montauban</span>, scheduled for July 24, 
1916, had to be postponed until the morning of the 29th. He comments that 
torrential rain caused this delay - which lacked any special significance. The following 
deposition, dictated by, read over, and then signed by <span class="char">Dr. Yu Tsun</span>, former teacher 
of English at the <span class="place">Tsingtao Hochschule</span>, casts unsuspected light upon this event. The 
first two pages are missing.</p> 

<p>. . . and I hung up the phone. Immediately I recollected the voice that had spoken in 
German. It was that of <span class="char">Captain Richard Madden</span>. <span class="char">Madden</span>, in <span class="place">Viktor Runeberg's 
office</span>, meant the end of all our work and - though this seemed a secondary matter, 
or should have seemed so to me - of our lives also. His being there meant that 
<span class="char">Runeberg</span> had been arrested or murdered <span data-toggle="modal" data-target="#note1EN" class="note">[1].</span> Before the sun set on this same day, I ran 
the same risk. <span class="char">Madden</span> was implacable. Rather, to be more accurate, he was obliged 
to be implacable. <span class="char">An Irishman</span> in the service of <span class="place">England</span>, a man suspected of equivocal 
feelings if not of actual treachery, how could he fail to welcome and seize upon this 
extraordinary piece of luck: the discovery, capture and perhaps the deaths of <span class="char">two 
agents</span> of <span class="place">Imperial Germany</span>?</p>

<p>I went up to my bedroom. Absurd though the gesture was, I closed and locked the 
door. I threw myself down on my narrow iron bed, and waited on my back. The 
never changing rooftops filled the window, and the hazy six o'clock sun hung in the 
sky. It seemed incredible that this day, a day without warnings or omens, might be 
that of my implacable death. In despite of my dead father, in despite of having been a 
child in one of the symmetrical gardens of <span class="place">Hai Feng</span>, was I to die now?</p>

<p><span class="quot">Then I reflected that all things happen, happen to one, precisely now. Century 
follows century, and things happen only in the present. There are countless men in 
the air, on land and at sea, and all that really happens happens to me</span> . . . The almost 
unbearable memory of <span class="char">Madden</span>'s long horseface put an end to these wandering 
thoughts.</p>

<p>In the midst of my hatred and terror (now that it no longer matters to me to speak 
of terror, now that I have outwitted <span class="char">Richard Madden</span>, now that my neck hankers for 
the hangman's noose), I knew that the fast-moving and doubtless happy soldier did 
not suspect that I possessed the Secret - the name of the exact site of the new 
British artillery park on the <span class="place">Ancre</span>. A bird streaked across the misty sky and, 
absently, I turned it into an airplane and then that airplane into many in the skies of 
<span class="place">France</span>, shattering the artillery park under a rain of bombs. If only my mouth, before 
it should be silenced by a bullet, could shout this name in such a way that it could be 
heard in <span class="place">Germany</span> ... My voice, my human voice, was weak. How could it reach the 
ear of the Chief? The ear of that sick and hateful man who knew nothing of 
<span class="char">Runeberg</span> or of me except that we were in <span class="place">Staffordshire</span>. A man who, sitting in his 
arid <span class="place">Berlin</span> office, leafed infinitely through newspapers, looking in vain for news from 
us. I said aloud, "I must flee."</p>

<p>I sat up on the bed, in senseless and perfect silence, as if <span class="char">Madden</span> was already peering 
at me. Something - perhaps merely a desire to prove my total penury to myself - 
made me empty out my pockets. I found just what I knew I was going to find. The 
American watch, the nickel-plated chain and the square coin, the key ring with the 
useless but compromising keys to <span class="place">Runeberg's office</span>, the notebook, a letter which I 
decided to destroy at once (and which I did not destroy), a five shilling piece, two 
single shillings and some pennies, a red and blue pencil, a handkerchief - and a 
revolver with a single bullet. Absurdly I held it and weighed it in my hand, to give 
myself courage. Vaguely I thought that a pistol shot can be heard for a great distance.</p> 

<p>In ten minutes I had developed my plan. The telephone directory gave me the name 
of the one person capable of passing on the information. He lived in a suburb of 
<span class="place">Fenton</span>, less than half an hour away by train.</p>

<p>I am a timorous man. I can say it now, now that I have brought my incredibly risky 
plan to an end. It was not easy to bring about, and I know that its execution was 
terrible. I did not do it for <span class="place">Germany</span> - no! Such a barbarous country is of no 
importance to me, particularly since it had degraded me by making me become a spy. 
Furthermore, I knew <span class="char">an Englishman</span> - a modest man - who, for me, is as great as 
Goethe. I did not speak with him for more than an hour, but during that time, he 
was Goethe.</p>

<p>I carried out my plan because I felt <span class="char">the Chief</span> had some fear of those of my race, of 
those uncountable forebears whose culmination lies in me. I wished to prove to him 
that <span class="char">a yellow man</span> could save his armies. Besides, I had to escape <span class="char">the Captain</span>. His 
hands and voice could, at any moment, knock and beckon at my door.</p> 

<p>Silently, I dressed, took leave of myself in the mirror, went down the stairs, sneaked 
a look at the quiet street, and went out. The station was not far from my house, but 
I thought it more prudent to take a cab. I told myself that I thus ran less chance of 
being recognized. The truth is that, in the deserted street, I felt infinitely visible and 
vulnerable. I recall that I told the driver to stop short of the main entrance. I got out 
with a painful and deliberate slowness.</p> 

<p>I was going to <span class="place">the village of Ashgrove</span>, but took a ticket for a station further on. The 
train would leave in a few minutes, at eight-fifty. I hurried, for the next would not go 
until half past nine. There was almost no one on the platform. I walked through the 
carriages. I remember some farmers, a woman dressed in mourning, a youth deep in 
Tacitus' Annals and a wounded, happy soldier.</p> 

<p>At last the train pulled out. A man I recognized ran furiously, but vainly, the length of 
the platform. It was <span class="char">Captain Richard Madden</span>. Shattered, trembling, I huddled in the 
distant corner of the seat, as far as possible from the fearful window.</p> 

<p>From utter terror I passed into a state of almost abject happiness. I told myself that 
the duel had already started and that I had won the first encounter by besting my 
adversary in his first attack - even if it was only for forty minutes - by an accident of 
fate. I argued that so small a victory prefigured a total victory. I argued that it was 
not so trivial, that were it not for the precious accident of the train schedule, I 
would be in prison or dead. I argued, with no less sophism, that my timorous 
happiness was proof that I was man enough to bring this adventure to a successful 
conclusion. From my weakness I drew strength that never left me.</p> 

<p>I foresee that man will resign himself each day to new abominations, that soon only 
soldiers and bandits will be left. To them I offer this advice: Whosoever would 
undertake some atrocious enterprise should act as if it were already accomplished, 
should impose upon himself a future as irrevocable as the past.</p> 

<p>Thus I proceeded, while with the eyes of a man already dead, I contemplated the 
fluctuations of the day which would probably be my last, and watched the diffuse 
coming of night.</p> 

<p>The train crept along gently, amid ash trees. It slowed down and stopped, almost in 
the middle of a field. No one called the name of a station. "<span class="place">Ashgrove</span>?" I asked some 
children on the platform. "<span class="place">Ashgrove</span>," they replied. I got out.</p> 

<p>A lamp lit the platform, but the children's faces remained in a shadow. One of them 
asked me: "Are you going to <span class="char">Dr. Stephen Albert</span>'s house?" Without waiting for my 
answer, another said: "The house is a good distance away but you won't get lost if 
you take the road to the left and bear to the left at every crossroad." I threw them a 
coin (my last), went down some stone steps and started along a deserted road. At a 
slight incline, the road ran downhill. It was a plain dirt way, and overhead the 
branches of trees intermingled, while a round moon hung low in the sky as if to keep 
me company.</p> 

<p>For a moment I thought that <span class="char">Richard Madden</span> might in some way have divined my 
desperate intent. At once I realized that this would be impossible. <span class="quot">The advice about 
turning always to the left reminded me that such was the common formula for 
finding the central courtyard of certain labyrinths.</span> I know something about 
labyrinths. Not for nothing am I the greatgrandson of <span class="char">Ts'ui Pen</span>. He was Governor of 
<span class="place">Yunnan</span> and gave up temporal power to write a novel with more characters than 
there are in the Hung Lou Meng, and to create a maze in which all men would lose 
themselves. He spent thirteen years on these oddly assorted tasks before he was 
assassinated by a stranger. His novel had no sense to it and nobody ever found his 
labyrinth.</p> 

<p>Under the trees of <span class="place">England</span> I meditated on this lost and perhaps mythical labyrinth. I 
imagined it untouched and perfect on the secret summit of some mountain; I 
imagined it drowned under rice paddies or beneath the sea; I imagined it infinite, 
made not only of eight-sided pavilions and of twisting paths but also of rivers, 
provinces and kingdoms ... <span class="quot">I thought of a maze of mazes, of a sinuous, ever growing 
maze which would take in both past and future and would somehow involve the 
stars.</span></p> 

<p>Lost in these imaginary illusions I forgot my destiny - that of the hunted. For an 
undetermined period of time I felt myself cut off from the world, an abstract 
spectator. The hazy and murmuring countryside, the moon, the decline of the 
evening, stirred within me. Going down the gently sloping road I could not feel 
fatigue. The evening was at once intimate and infinite.</p> 

<p>The road kept descending and branching off, through meadows misty in the twilight. 
A high-pitched and almost syllabic music kept coming and going, moving with the 
breeze, blurred by the leaves and by distance.</p> 

<p>I thought that a man might be an enemy of other men, of the differing moments of 
other men, but never an enemy of a country: not of fireflies, words, gardens, 
streams, or the West wind.</p> 

<p>Meditating thus I arrived at a high, rusty iron gate. Through the railings I could see an 
avenue bordered with poplar trees and also a kind of <span class="place">summer house or pavilion</span>. 
Two things dawned on me at once, the first trivial and the second almost incredible: 
the music came from the pavilion and that music was Chinese. That was why I had 
accepted it fully, without paying it any attention. I do not remember whether there 
was a bell, a push-button, or whether I attracted attention by clapping my hands. The 
stuttering sparks of the music kept on.</p> 

<p>But from the end of the avenue, from <span class="place">the main house</span>, a lantern approached; a 
lantern which alternately, from moment to moment, was crisscrossed or put out by 
the trunks of the trees; a paper lantern shaped like a drum and colored like the 
moon. <span class="char">A tall man</span> carried it. I could not see his face for the light blinded me.</p> 

<p>He opened the gate and spoke slowly in my language.</p> 

<p>"I see that the worthy <span class="char">Hsi P'eng</span> has troubled himself to see to relieving my solitude. 
No doubt you want to see <span class="place">the garden</span>?"</p>

<p>Recognizing the name of one of our consuls, I replied, somewhat taken aback.</p> 

<p>"The garden?"</p> 

<p>"<span class="place">The garden of forking paths</span>."</p> 

<p>Something stirred in my memory and I said, with incomprehensible assurance:</p> 

<p>"The garden of my ancestor, <span class="char">Ts'ui Pen</span>."</p> 

<p>"Your ancestor? Your illustrious ancestor? Come in."</p> 

<p>The damp path zigzagged like those of my childhood. When we reached the house, 
we went into a library filled with books from both <span class="place">East</span> and <span class="place">West</span>. I recognized some 
large volumes bound in yellow silk-manuscripts of the Lost Encyclopedia which was 
edited by the <span class="char">Third Emperor of the Luminous Dynasty</span>. They had never been 
printed. A phonograph record was spinning near a bronze phoenix. I remember also 
a rose-glazed jar and yet another, older by many centuries, of that blue color which 
our potters copied from the Persians . . .</p>

<p><span class="char">Stephen Albert</span> was watching me with a smile on his face. He was, as I have said, 
remarkably tall. <span class="quot">His face was deeply lined and he had gray eyes and a gray beard. 
There was about him something of the priest</span>, and something of the sailor. Later, he 
told me he had been a missionary in <span class="place">Tientsin</span> before he "had aspired to become a 
Sinologist."</p>

<p>We sat down, I upon a large, low divan, he with his back to the window and to a 
large circular clock. I calculated that my pursuer, <span class="char">Richard Madden</span>, could not arrive in 
less than an hour. My irrevocable decision could wait.</p> 

<p>"A strange destiny," said <span class="char">Stephen Albert</span>, "that of <span class="char">Ts'ui Pen</span> - Governor of his native 
province, learned in astronomy, in astrology and tireless in the interpretation of the 
canonical books, a chess player, a famous poet and a calligrapher. Yet he abandoned 
all to make a book and a labyrinth. He gave up all the pleasures of oppression, 
justice, of a well-stocked bed, of banquets, and even of erudition, and shut himself up 
in <span class="place">the Pavilion of the Limpid Sun</span> for thirteen years. At his death, his heirs found only 
a mess of manuscripts. The family, as you doubtless know, wished to consign them 
to the fire, but the executor of the estate - a Taoist or a Buddhist monk - insisted on 
their publication."</p> 

<p>"Those of the blood of <span class="char">Ts'ui Pen</span>," I replied, "still curse the memory of that monk. 
Such a publication was madness. The book is a shapeless mass of contradictory 
rough drafts. I examined it once upon a time: the hero dies in the third chapter, 
while in the fourth he is alive. As for that other enterprise of <span class="char">Ts'ui Pen</span> ... his 
Labyrinth . . ."</p> 

<p>"Here is the Labyrinth," <span class="char">Albert</span> said, pointing to a tall, laquered writing cabinet.</p> 

<p>"An ivory labyrinth?" I exclaimed. "A tiny labyrinth indeed . . . !"</p> 

<p>"A symbolic labyrinth," he corrected me. "An invisible labyrinth of time. I, a 
barbarous Englishman, have been given the key to this transparent mystery. After 
more than a hundred years most of the details are irrecoverable, lost beyond all 
recall, but it isn't hard to image what must have happened. At one time, <span class="char">Ts'ui Pen</span> 
must have said; 'I am going into seclusion to write a book,' and at another, 'I am 
retiring to construct a maze.' Everyone assumed these were separate activities. <span class="quot">No 
one realized that the book and the labyrinth were one and the same.</span> <span class="place">The Pavilion of 
the Limpid Sun</span> was set in the middle of an intricate garden. This may have suggested 
the idea of a physical maze.</p> 

<p>"<span class="char">Ts'ui Pen</span> died. In all the vast lands which once belonged to your family, no one 
could find the labyrinth. The novel's confusion suggested that it was the labyrinth.</p> 

<p>Two circumstances showed me the direct solution to the problem. First, the curious 
legend that <span class="char">Ts'ui Pen</span> had proposed to create an infinite maze, second, a fragment of 
a letter which I discovered."</p> 

<p><span class="char">Albert</span> rose. For a few moments he turned his back to me. He opened the top 
drawer in the high black and gilded writing cabinet. He returned holding in his hand a 
piece of paper which had once been crimson but which had faded with the passage 
of time: it was rose colored, tenuous, quadrangular. <span class="char">Ts'ui Pen</span>'s calligraphy was justly 
famous. Eagerly, but without understanding, I read the words which a man of my 
own blood had written with a small brush: "I leave to various future times, but not 
to all, my garden of forking paths."</p>

<p>I handed back the sheet of paper in silence. <span class="char">Albert</span> went on:</p> 

<p>"Before I discovered this letter, <span class="quot">I kept asking myself how a book could be infinite. I 
could not imagine any other than a cyclic volume, circular. A volume whose last page 
would be the same as the first and so have the possibility of continuing indefinitely.</span> I 
recalled, too, the night in the middle of The Thousand and One Nights when <span class="char">Queen 
Scheherezade</span>, through a magical mistake on the part of her copyist, started to tell 
the story of The Thousand and One Nights, with the risk of again arriving at the 
night upon which she will relate it, and thus on to infinity. I also imagined a Platonic 
hereditary work, passed on from father to son, to which each individual would add a 
new chapter or correct, with pious care, the work of his elders.</p> 

<p>"These conjectures gave me amusement, but none seemed to have the remotest 
application to the contradictory chapters of <span class="char">Ts'ui Pen</span>. At this point, I was sent from 
<span class="place">Oxford</span> the manuscript you have just seen.</p> 

<p>"Naturally, my attention was caught by the sentence, 'I leave to various future times, 
but not to all, my garden of forking paths: I had no sooner read this, than I 
understood. <span class="quot">The Garden of Forking Paths was the chaotic novel itself. The phrase 'to 
various future times, but not to all' suggested the image of bifurcating in time, not in 
space. Rereading the whole work confirmed this theory. In all fiction, when a man is 
faced with alternatives he chooses one at the expense of the others. In the almost 
unfathomable Ts'ui Pen, he chooses - simultaneously - all of them. He thus creates 
various futures, various times which start others that will in their turn branch out 
and bifurcate in other times. This is the cause of the contradictions in the novel.</span></p> 

<p>"<span class="char">Fang</span>, let us say, has a secret. A stranger knocks at his door. <span class="char">Fang</span> makes up his mind 
to kill him. Naturally there are various possible outcomes. <span class="char">Fang</span> can kill the intruder, 
the intruder can kill <span class="char">Fang</span>, both can be saved, both can die and so on and so on. In 
<span class="char">Ts'ui Pen</span>'s work, all the possible solutions occur, each one being the point of 
departure for other bifurcations. Sometimes the pathways of this labyrinth converge. 
For example, you come to this house; but in other possible pasts you are my enemy; 
in others my friend.</p> 

<p>"If you will put up with my atrocious pronunciation, I would like to read you a few 
pages of your ancestor's work."</p> 

<p>His countenance, in the bright circle of lamplight, was certainly that of an ancient, but 
it shone with something unyielding, even immortal.</p> 

<p>With slow precision, he read two versions of the same epic chapter. In the first, an 
army marches into battle over a desolate mountain pass. The bleak and somber 
aspect of the rocky landscape made the soldiers feel that life itself was of little value, 
and so they won the battle easily. In the second, the same army passes through a 
palace where a banquet is in progress. The splendor of the feast remained a memory 
throughout the glorious battle, and so victory followed.</p> 

<p>With proper veneration I listened to these old tales, although perhaps with less 
admiration for them in themselves than for the fact that they had been thought out 
by one of my own blood, and that a man of a distant empire had given them back to 
me, in the last stage of a desperate adventure, on <span class="place">a Western island</span>. I remember the 
final words, repeated at the end of each version like a secret command: "Thus the 
heroes fought, with tranquil heart and bloody sword. They were resigned to killing 
and to dying."</p> 

<p>At that moment I felt within me and around me something invisible and intangible 
pullulating. It was not the pullulation of two divergent, parallel, and finally converging 
armies, but an agitation more inaccessible, more intimate, prefigured by them in 
some way. <span class="char">Stephen Albert</span> continued:</p> 

<p>"I do not think that your illustrious ancestor toyed idly with variations. I do not find 
it believable that he would waste thirteen years laboring over a never ending 
experiment in rhetoric. In your country the novel is an inferior genre; in <span class="char">Ts'ui Pen</span>'s 
period, it was a despised one. <span class="char">Ts'ui Pen</span> was a fine novelist but he was also a man of 
letters who, doubtless, considered himself more than a mere novelist. The testimony 
of his contemporaries attests to this, and certainly the known facts of his life confirm 
his leanings toward the metaphysical and the mystical. Philosophical conjectures take 
up the greater part of his novel. I know that of all problems, none disquieted him 
more, and none concerned him more than the profound one of time. Now then, this 
is the only problem that does not figure in the pages of The Garden. He does not 
even use the word which means time. How can these voluntary omissions be 
explained?"</p> 

<p>I proposed various solutions, all of them inadequate. We discussed them. Finally 
<span class="char">Stephen Albert</span> said: "In a guessing game to which the answer is chess, which word is 
the only one prohibited?" I thought for a moment and then replied:</p> 

<p>"The word is chess."</p> 

<p>"Precisely," said <span class="char">Albert</span>. "<span class="quot">The Garden of Forking Paths is an enormous guessing game, 
or parable, in which the subject is time. The rules of the game forbid the use of the 
word itself. To eliminate a word completely, to refer to it by means of inept phrases 
and obvious paraphrases, is perhaps the best way of drawing attention to it.</span> This, 
then, is the tortuous method of approach preferred by the oblique <span class="char">Ts'ui Pen</span> in every 
meandering of his interminable novel. I have gone over hundreds of manuscripts, I 
have corrected errors introduced by careless copyists, I have worked out the plan 
from this chaos, I have restored, or believe I have restored, the original. I have 
translated the whole work. I can state categorically that not once has the word time 
been used in the whole book.</p> 

<p>"The explanation is obvious. The Garden of Forking Paths is a picture, incomplete 
yet not false, of the universe such as <span class="char">Ts'ui Pen</span> conceived it to be. Differing from 
Newton and Schopenhauer, your ancestor did not think of time as absolute and 
uniform. He believed in an infinite series of times, in a dizzily growing, ever spreading 
network of diverging, converging and parallel times. This web of time - the strands of 
which approach one another, bifurcate, intersect or ignore each other through the 
centuries - embraces every possibility. We do not exist in most of them. In some 
you exist and not I, while in others I do, and you do not, and in yet others both of us 
exist. In this one, in which chance has favored me, you have come to my gate. In 
another, you, crossing the garden, have found me dead. In yet another, I say these 
very same words, but am an error, a phantom."</p> 

<p>"In all of them," I enunciated, with a tremor in my voice. "I deeply appreciate and am 
grateful to you for the restoration of <span class="char">Ts'ui Pen</span>'s garden."</p> 

<p>"Not in all," he murmured with a smile. "Time is forever dividing itself toward 
innumerable futures and in one of them I am your enemy."</p> 

<p>Once again I sensed the pullulation of which I have already spoken. It seemed to me 
that the dew-damp garden surrounding the house was infinitely saturated with 
invisible people. All were <span class="char">Albert</span> and myself, secretive, busy and multiform in other 
dimensions of time. I lifted my eyes and the short nightmare disappeared. In the 
black and yellow garden there was only a single man, but this man was as strong as a 
statue and this man was walking up the path and he was <span class="char">Captain Richard Madden</span>.</p> 

<p>"The future exists now," I replied. "But I am your friend. Can I take another look at 
the letter?"</p> 

<p><span class="char">Albert</span> rose from his seat. He stood up tall as he opened the top drawer of the high 
writing cabinet. For a moment his back was again turned to me. I had the revolver 
ready. I fired with the utmost care: <span class="char">Albert</span> fell without a murmur, at once. I swear 
that his death was instantaneous, as if he had been struck by lightning.</p> 

<p>What remains is unreal and unimportant. <span class="char">Madden</span> broke in and arrested me. I have 
been condemned to hang. Abominably, I have yet triumphed! The secret name of the 
city to be attacked got through to <span class="place">Berlin</span>. Yesterday it was bombed. I read the news 
in the same English newspapers which were trying to solve the riddle of the murder 
of the learned Sinologist <span class="char">Stephen Albert</span> by the unknown <span class="char">Yu Tsun</span>. <span class="char">The Chief</span>, 
however, had already solved this mystery. He knew that my problem was to shout, 
with my feeble voice, above the tumult of war, the name of the city called <span class="place">Albert</span>, 
and that I had no other course open to me than to kill someone of that name. He 
does not know, for no one can, of my infinite penitence and sickness of the heart.</p>

			<p>En la página 22 de la <i>Historia de la Guerra Europea</i>, de Liddell Hart, se lee que una
ofensiva de trece divisiones británicas (apoyadas por mil cuatrocientas piezas de artillería)
contra la línea SerreMontauban había sido planeada para el veinticuatro de julio de 1916 y
debió postergarse hasta la mañana del día veintinueve. Las lluvias torrenciales (anota el
capitán Liddell Hart) provocaron esa demora -nada significativa, por cierto-. La siguiente
declaración, dictada, releída y firmada por el doctor Yu Tsun, antiguo catedrático de inglés
en la Hochschule de Tsingtao, arroja una insospechada luz sobre el caso. Faltan las dos
páginas iniciales.</p>

<p>&laquo;... y colgué el tubo. Inmediatamente después, reconocí la voz que había contestado en
alemán. Era la del capitán Richard Madden. Madden, en el departamento de Viktor
Runeberg, quería decir el fin de nuestros afanes y -pero eso parecía muy secundario, o
debía parecérmelo- también de nuestras vidas. Quería decir que Runeberg había sido
arrestado o asesinado <span data-toggle="modal" data-target="#note1ES" class="note">[1].</span> Antes que declinara el sol de ese día, yo correría la misma suerte.
Madden era implacable. Mejor dicho, estaba obligado a ser implacable. Irlandés a las
órdenes de Inglaterra, hombre acusado de tibieza y tal vez de traición ¿cómo no iba a
abrazar y agradecer este milagroso favor: el descubrimiento, la captura, quizá la, muerte,
de dos agentes del Imperio alemán? Subí a mi cuarto; absurdamente cerré la puerta con
llave y me tiré de espaldas en la estrecha cama de hierro. En la ventana estaban los
tejados de siempre y el sol nublado de las seis. Me pareció increíble que ese día sin
premoniciones ni símbolos fuera el de mi muerte implacable. A pesar de mi padre muerto,
a pesar de haber sido un niño en un simétrico jardín de Ha¡ Feng ¿yo, ahora, iba a morir?
Después reflexioné que todas las cosas le suceden a uno precisamente, precisamente
ahora. Siglos de siglos y sólo en el presente ocurren los hechos; innumerables hombres
en el aire, en la tierra y el mar, y todo lo que realmente pasa me pasa a mí... El casi
intolerable recuerdo del rostro acaballado de Madden abolió esas divagaciones. En mitad
de mi odio y de mi terror (ahora no me importa hablar de terror: ahora que he burlado a
Richard Madden, ahora que mi garganta anhela la cuerda) Pênsé que ese guerrero
tumultuoso y sin duda feliz no sospechaba que yo poseía el Secreto. El nombre del preciso
lugar del nuevo parque de artillería británico sobre el Ancre. Un pájaro rayó el cielo gris y
ciegamente lo traduje en un aeroplano y a ese aeroplano en muchos (en el cielo francés)
aniquilando el parque de artillería con bombas verticales. Si mi boca, antes que la
deshiciera un balazo, pudiera gritar ese nombre de modo que lo oyeran en Alemania... Mi
voz humana era muy pobre. ¿Cómo hacerla llegar al oído del Jefe? Al oído de aquel
hombre enfermo y odioso, que no sabía de Runeberg y de mí sino que estábamos en Staffordshire 
y que en vano esperaba noticias nuestras en su árida oficina de Berlín,
examinando infinitamente periódicos... Dije en voz alta: &laquo;Debo huir&raquo;. Me incorporé sin
ruido, en una inútil perfección de silencio, como si Madden ya estuviera acechándome.
Algo -tal vez la mera ostentación de probar que mis recursos eran nulos- me hizo revisar
mis bolsillos. Encontré lo que sabía que iba a encontrar: el reloj norteamericano, la
cadena de níquel y la moneda cuadrangular, el llavero con las comprometedoras llaves
inútiles del departamento de Runeberg, la libreta, una carta que resolví destruir
inmediatamente (y que no destruí), una corona, dos chelines y unos Pêniques, el lápiz
rojo-azul, el pañuelo, el revólver con una bala. Absurdamente lo empuñé y sopesé para
darme valor. Vagamente Pênsé que un pistoletazo puede oírse muy lejos. En diez minutos
mi plan estaba maduro. La guía telefónica me dio el nombre de la única persona capaz de
transmitir la noticia: vivía en un suburbio de Fenton, a menos de media hora de tren.</p>

<p>&raquo;Soy un hombre cobarde. Ahora lo digo, ahora que he llevado a término un plan que
nadie no calificará de arriesgado. Yo sé que fue terrible su ejecución. No lo hice por
Alemania, no. Nada me importa un país bárbaro, que me ha obligado a la abyección de
ser un espía. Además, yo sé de un hombre de Inglaterra -un hombre modesto- que para
mí no es menos que Goethe. Arriba de una hora no hablé con él, pero durante una hora
fue Goethe... Lo hice, porque yo sentía que el jefe temía un poco a los de mi raza -a los
innumerables antepasados que confluyen en mí-. Yo quería probarle que un amarillo podía
salvar a sus ejércitos. Además, yo debía huir del capitán. Sus manos y su voz podían
golpear en cualquier momento a mi puerta. Me vestí sin ruido, me dije adiós en el espejo,
bajé, escudriñé la calle tranquila y salí. La estación no distaba mucho de casa, pero
juzgué preferible tomar un coche. Argüí que así corría menos peligro de ser reconocido; el
hecho es que en la calle desierta me sentía visible y vulnerable, infinitamente. Recuerdo
que le dije al cochero que se detuviera un poco antes de la entrada central. Bajé con
lentitud voluntaria y casi Pênosa; iba a la aldea de Ashgrove, pero saqué un pasaje para
una estación más lejana. El tren salía dentro de muy pocos minutos, a las ocho y
cincuenta. Me apresuré; el próximo saldría a las nueve y media. No había casi nadie en el
andén. Recorrí los coches: recuerdo unos labradores, una enlutada, un joven que leía con
fervor los Anales de Tácito, un soldado herido y feliz. Los coches arrancaron al fin. Un
hombre que reconocí corrió en vano hasta el límite del andén. Era el capitán Richard
Madden. Aniquilado, trémulo, me encogí en la otra punta del sillón, lejos del temido
cristal.</p>

<p>&raquo;De esta aniquilación pasé a una felicidad casi abyecta. Me dije que ya estaba
empeñado mi duelo y que yo había ganado el primer asalto, al burlar, siquiera por
cuarenta minutos, siquiera por un favor del azar, el ataque de mi adversario. Argüí que
esa victoria mínima prefiguraba la victoria total. Argüí que no era mínima, ya que sin esa
diferencia preciosa que el horario de trenes me deparaba, yo estaría en la cárcel, o
muerto. Argüí (no menos sofísticamente) que mi felicidad cobarde probaba que yo era
hombre capaz de llevar a buen término la aventura. De esa debilidad saqué fuerzas que
no me abandonaron. Preveo que el hombre se resignará cada día a empresas más
atroces; pronto no habrá sino guerreros y bandoleros; les doy este consejo: "El ejecutor
de una empresa atroz debe imaginar que ya la ha cumplido, debe imponerse un porvenir
que sea irrevocable como el pasado". Así procedí yo, mientras mis ojos de hombre ya
muerto registraban la fluencia de aquel día que era tal vez el último, y la difusión de la
noche. El tren corría con dulzura, entre fresnos. Se detuvo, casi en medio del campo.
Nadie gritó el nombre de la estación. "¿Ashgrove?", les pregunté a unos chicos en el
andén. "Ashgrove", contestaron. Bajé. &raquo;Una lámpara ilustraba el andén, pero las caras de
los niños quedaban en la zona de sombra. Uno me interrogó: "¿Usted va a. casa del 
doctor Stephen Albert?" Sin aguardar contestación, otro dijo: "La casa queda lejos de
aquí, pero usted no se perderá si toma ese camino a la izquierda y en cada encrucijada
del camino dobla a la izquierda. Les arrojé una moneda (la última), bajé unos escalones
de piedra y entré en el solitario camino. Éste, lentamente, bajaba. Era de tierra elemental,
arriba se confundían las ramas, la luna baja y circular parecía acompañarme.</p>

<p>&raquo;Por un instante, Pênsé que Richard Madden había Pênetrado de algún modo mi
desesperado propósito. Muy pronto comprendí que eso era imposible. El consejo de
siempre doblar a la izquierda me recordó que tal era el procedimiento común para
descubrir el patio central de ciertos laberintos. Algo entiendo de laberintos; no en vano
soy bisnieto de aquel Ts'ui Pên, que fue gobernador de Yunnan y que renunció al poder
temporal para escribir una novela que fuera todavía más populosa que el Hung Lu Meng y
para edificar un laberinto en el que se perdieran todos los hombres. Trece años dedicó a
esas heterogéneas fatigas, pero la mano de un forastero lo asesinó y su novela era
insensata y nadie encontró el laberinto. Bajo los árboles ingleses medité en ese laberinto
perdido: lo imaginé inviolado y perfecto en la cumbre secreta de una montaña, lo imaginé
borrado por arrozales o debajo del agua, lo imaginé infinito, no ya de quioscos ochavados
y de sendas que vuelven, sino de ríos y provincias y reinos... Pênsé en un laberinto de
laberintos, en un sinuoso laberinto creciente que abarcara el pasado y el porvenir y que
implicara de algún modo los astros. Absorto en esas ilusorias imágenes, olvidé mi destino
de perseguido. Me sentí, por un tiempo indeterminado, percibidor abstracto del mundo. El
vago y vivo campo, la luna, los restos de la tarde, obraron en mí; asimismo el declive que
eliminaba cualquier posibilidad de cansancio. La tarde era íntima, infinita. El camino
bajaba y se bifurcaba, entre las ya confusas praderas. Una música aguda y como silábica
se aproximaba y se alejaba en el vaivén del viento, empañada de hojas y de distancia.
Pênsé que un hombre puede ser enemigo de otros hombres, de otros momentos de otros
hombres, pero no de un país; no de luciérnagas, palabras, jardines, cursos de agua,
ponientes. Llegué, así, a un alto portón herrumbrado. Entre las rejas descifré una alameda
y una especie de pabellón. Comprendí, de pronto, dos cosas, la primera trivial, la segunda
casi increíble: la música venía del pabellón, la música era china. Por eso, yo la había
aceptado con plenitud, sin prestarle atención. No recuerdo si había una campana o un
timbre o si llamé golpeando las manos. El chisporroteo de la música prosiguió.</p>

<p>&raquo;Pero del fondo de la íntima casa un farol se acercaba: un farol que rayaban y a ratos
anulaban los troncos, un farol de papel, que tenía la forma de los tambores y el color de la
luna. Lo traía un hombre alto. No vi su rostro, porque me cegaba la luz. Abrió el portón y
dijo lentamente en mi idioma:</p>

<p>&raquo;-Veo que el piadoso Hsi Pêng se empeña en corregir mi soledad. ¿Usted sin duda
querrá ver el jardín?</p>

<p>Reconocí el nombre de uno de nuestros cónsules y repetí desconcertado:</p>

<p>&raquo;-¿El jardín?</p>

<p>&raquo;-El jardín de senderos que se bifurcan.</p>

<p>&raquo;Algo se agitó en mi recuerdo y pronuncié con incomprensible seguridad:</p>

<p>&raquo;-El jardín de mi antepasado Ts'ui Pén.</p>

<p>&raquo;-¿Su antepasado? ¿Su ilustre antepasado? Adelante.</p>

<p>&raquo;El húmedo sendero zigzagueaba como los de mi infancia. Llegamos a una biblioteca de
libros orientales y occidentales. Reconocí, encuadernados en seda amarilla, algunos tomos
manuscritos de la Enciclopedia Perdida que dirigió el Tercer Emperador de la Dinastía
Luminosa y que no se dio nunca a la imprenta. El disco del gramófono giraba junto a un
fénix de bronce. Recuerdo también un jarrón de la familia rosa y otro, anterior de muchos
siglos, de ese color azul que nuestros artífices copiaron de los alfareros de Persia...</p>

<p>&raquo;Stephen Albert me observaba, sonriente. Era (ya lo dije) muy alto, de rasgos
afilados, de ojos grises y barba gris. Algo de sacerdote había en él y también de marino;
después me refirió que había sido misionero en Tientsin "antes de aspirar a sinólogo".</p>

<p>&raquo;Nos sentamos; yo en un largo y bajo diván; él de espaldas a la ventana y a un alto
reloj circular. Computé que antes de una hora no llegaría mi perseguidor, Richard
Madden. Mi determinación irrevocable podía esperar.</p>

<p>&raquo;-Asombroso destino el de Ts'ui Pên -dijo Stephen Albert-. Gobernador de su provincia
natal, docto en astronomía, en astrología y en la interpretación infatigable de los libros
canónicos, ajedrecista, famoso poeta y calígrafo: todo lo abandonó para componer un
libro y un laberinto. Renunció a los placeres de la opresión, de la justicia, del numeroso
lecho, de los banquetes y aun de la erudición, y se enclaustró durante trece años en el
Pabellón de la Límpida Soledad. A su muerte, los herederos no encontraron sino
manuscritos caóticos. La familia, como usted acaso no ignora, quiso adjudicarlos al fuego;
pero su albacea (un monje taoísta o budista) insistió en la publicación.</p>

<p>&raquo;-Los de la sangre de Ts'ui Pên -repliqué- seguimos execrando a ese monje. Esa
publicación fue insensata. El libro es un acervo indeciso de borradores contradictorios. Lo
he examinado alguna vez: en el tercer capítulo muere el héroe, en el cuarto está vivo. En
cuanto a la otra empresa de Ts'ui Pên, a su Laberinto...</p>

<p>&raquo;-Aquí está el Laberinto -dijo indicándome un alto escritorio laqueado.</p>

<p>&raquo;-¡Un laberinto de marfil! -exclamé-. Un laberinto mínimo...</p>

<p>&raquo;-Un laberinto de símbolos -corrigió-. Un invisible laberinto de tiempo. A mí, bárbaro
inglés, me ha sido deparado revelar ese misterio diáfano. Al cabo de más de cien años, los
pormenores son irrecuperables, pero no es difícil conjeturar lo que sucedió. Ts'ui Pên diría
una vez: "Me retiro a escribir un libro". Y otra: "Me retiro a construir un laberinto". Todos
imaginaron dos obras; nadie Pensó que libro y laberinto eran un solo objeto. El Pabellón
de la Límpida Soledad se erguía en el centro de un jardín tal vez intrincado; el hecho
puede haber sugerido a los hombres un laberinto físico. Ts’ui Pênmurió; nadie, en las
dilatadas tierras que fueron suyas, dio con el laberinto; la confusión de la novela me
sugirió que ése era el laberinto. Dos circunstancias me dieron la recta solución del
problema. Una: la curiosa leyenda de que Ts’ui Pên se había propuesto un laberinto que
fuera estrictamente infinito. Otra: un fragmento de una carta que descubrí.</p>

<p>&raquo;Albert se levantó. Me dio, por unos instantes, la espalda; abrió un cajón del áureo y
renegrido escritorio. Volvió con un papel antes carmesí; ahora rosado y tenue y
cuadriculado. Era justo el renombre caligráfico de Ts'ui Pên. Leí con incomprensión y
fervor estas palabras que con minucioso pincel redactó un hombre de mi sangre: "Dejo a
los varios porvenires (no a todos) mi jardín de senderos que se bifurcan". Devolví en
silencio la hoja. Albert prosiguió:</p>

<p>&raquo;-Antes de exhumar esta carta, yo me había preguntado de qué manera un libro puede
ser infinito. No conjeturé otro procedimiento que el de un volumen cíclico, circular. Un
volumen cuya última página fuera idéntica a la primera, con posibilidad de continuar
indefinidamente. Recordé también esa noche que está en el centro de Las mil y una
noches, cuando la reina Shahrazad (por una mágica distracción del copista) se pone a
referir textualmente la historia de Las mil y una noches, con riesgo de llegar otra vez a la
noche en que la refiere, y así hasta lo infinito. Imaginé también una obra platónica,
hereditaria, transmitida de padre a hijo, en la que cada nuevo individuo agregara un
capítulo o corrigiera con piadoso cuidado la página de los mayores. Esas conjeturas me
distrajeron; pero ninguna parecía corresponder, siquiera de un modo remoto, a los
contradictorios capítulos de Ts'ui Pên. En esa perplejidad, me remitieron de Oxford el
manuscrito que usted ha examinado. Me detuve, como es natural, en la frase: "Dejo a los
varios porvenires (no a todos) mi jardín de senderos que se bifurcan". Casi en el acto
comprendí; El jardín de senderos que se bifurcan era la novela caótica; la frase "varios
porvenires (no a todos)" me sugirió la imagen de la bifurcación en el tiempo, no en el
espacio. La relectura general de la obra confirmó esa teoría. En todas las ficciones, cada
vez que un hombre se enfrenta con diversas alternativas, opta por una y elimina las
otras; en la del casi inextricable Ts'ui Pên, opta -simultáneamente- por todas. Crea, así,
diversos porvenires, diversos tiempos, que también proliferan y se bifurcan. De ahí las
contradicciones de la novela. Fang, digamos, tiene un secreto; un desconocido llama a su
puerta; Fang resuelve matarlo. Naturalmente, hay varios desenlaces posibles: Fang puede
matar al intruso, el intruso puede matar a Fang, ambos pueden salvarse, ambos pueden
morir, etcétera. En la obra de Ts'ui Pên, todos los desenlaces ocurren; cada uno es el
punto de partida de otras bifurcaciones. Alguna vez, los senderos de ese laberinto
convergen: por ejemplo, usted llega a esta casa, pero en uno de los pasados posibles
usted es mi enemigo, en otro mi amigo. Si se resigna usted a mi pronunciación incurable,
leeremos unas páginas.</p>

<p>&raquo;Su rostro, en el vívido círculo de la lámpara, era sin duda el de un anciano, pero con
algo inquebrantable y aun inmortal. Leyó con lenta precisión dos redacciones de un mismo
capítulo épico. En la primera, un ejército marcha hacia una batalla a través de una
montaña desierta; el horror de las piedras y de la sombra le hace menospreciar la vida y
logra con facilidad la victoria; en la segunda, el mismo ejército atraviesa un palacio en el
que hay una fiesta; la resplandeciente batalla les parece una continuación de la fiesta y
logran la victoria. Yo oía con decente veneración esas viejas ficciones, acaso menos
admirables que el hecho de que las hubiera ideado mi sangre y de que un hombre de un
imperio remoto me las restituyera, en el curso de una desesperada aventura, en una isla
occidental.</p>

<p>Recuerdo las palabras finales, repetidas en cada redacción como un mandamiento
secreto: "Así combatieron los héroes, tranquilo el admirable corazón, violenta la espada,
resignados a matar y a morir".</p>

<p>&raquo;Desde ese instante, sentí a mi alrededor y en mi oscuro cuerpo una invisible,
intangible pululación. No la pululación de los divergentes, paralelos y finalmente
coalescentes ejércitos, sino una agitación más inaccesible, más intima y que ellos de
algún modo prefiguraban. Stephen Albert prosiguió:</p>

<p>&raquo;-No creo que su ilustre antepasado jugara ociosamente a las variaciones. No juzgo
verosímil que sacrificara trece años a la infinita ejecución de un experimento retórico. En
su país, la novela es un género subalterno; en aquel tiempo era un género despreciable.
Ts’ui Pên fue un novelista genial, pero también fue un hombre de letras que sin duda no
se consideró un mero novelista. El testimonio de sus contemporáneos proclamaba -y
harto lo confirma su vida- sus aficiones metafísicas, místicas. La controversia filosófica
usurpa buena parte de su novela. Sé que de todos los problemas, ninguno lo inquietó y lo
trabajó como el abismal problema del tiempo. Ahora bien, ése es el único problema que
no figura en las páginas del Jardín. Ni siquiera usa la palabra que quiere decir tiempo.
¿Cómo se explica usted esa voluntaria omisión?</p>

<p>&raquo;Propuse varias soluciones; todas, insuficientes. Las discutimos; al fin, Stepheri Albert
me dijo:</p>

<p>&raquo;-En una adivinanza cuyo tema es el ajedrez ¿cuál es la única palabra prohibida?</p>

<p>&raquo;Reflexioné un momento y repuse:</p>

<p>&raquo;-La palabra ajedrez.</p>

<p>&raquo;-Precisamente -dijo Albert-, El jardín de senderos que se bifurcan es una enorme
adivinanza, o parábola, cuyo tema es el tiempo; esa causa recóndita le prohíbe la
mención de su nombre. Omitir siempre una palabra, recurrir a metáforas ineptas y a
perífrasis evidentes, es quizá el modo más enfático de indicarla. Es el modo tortuoso que
prefirió, en cada uno de los meandros de su infatigable novela, el oblicuo Ts'ui Pên. He
confrontado centenares de manuscritos, he corregido los errores que la negligencia de los
copistas ha introducido, he conjeturado el plan de ese caos, he restablecido, he creído
restablecer el orden primordial, he traducido la obra entera: me consta que no emplea
una sola vez la palabra tiempo. La explicación es obvia: El jardín de senderos que se
bifurcan es una imagen incompleta, pero no falsa, del universo tal como lo concebía Ts'ui
Pên. A diferencia de Newton y de Schopenhauer, su antepasado no creía en un tiempo
uniforme, absoluto. Creía en infinitas series de tiempos, en una red creciente y vertiginosa
de tiempos divergentes, convergentes y paralelos. Esa trama de tiempos que se
aproximan, se bifurcan, se cortan o que secularmente se ignoran, abarca todas las
posibilidades. No existimos en la mayoría de esos tiempos; en algunos existe usted y no
yo; en otros, yo, no usted; en otros, los dos. En éste, que un favorable azar me depara,
usted ha llegado a mi casa; en otro, usted, al atravesar el jardín, me ha encontrado
muerto; en otro, yo digo estas mismas palabras, pero soy un error, un fantasma.</p>

<p>&raquo;-En todos -articulé no sin un temblor- yo agradezco y venero su recreación del jardín
de Ts'ui Pên.</p>

<p>&raquo;-No en todos -murmuró con una sonrisa-. El tiempo se bifurca perpetuamente hacia
innumerables futuros. En uno de ellos soy su enemigo.</p>

<p>&raquo;Volví a sentir esa pululación de que hablé. Me pareció que el húmedo jardín que
rodeaba la casa estaba saturado hasta lo infinito de invisibles personas. Esas personas
eran Albert y yo, secretos, atareados y multiformes en otras dimensiones de tiempo. Alcé
los ojos y la tenue pesadilla se disipó. En el amarillo y negro jardín había un solo hombre;
pero ese hombre era fuerte como una estatua, pero ese hombre avanzaba por el sendero
y era el capitán Richard Madden.</p>

<p>&raquo;-El porvenir ya existe -respondí-, pero yo soy su amigo. ¿Puedo examinar de nuevo la
carta?</p>

<p>&raquo;Albert se levantó. Alto, abrió el cajón del alto escritorio; me dio por un momento la
espalda. Yo había preparado el revólver. Disparé con sumo cuidado: Albert se desplomó
sin una queja, inmediatamente. Yo juro que su muerte fue instantánea: una fulminación.</p>

<p>&raquo;Lo demás es irreal, insignificante. Madden irrumpió, me arrestó. He sido condenado a la
horca. Abominablemente he vencido: he comunicado a Berlín el secreto nombre de la
ciudad que deben atacar. Ayer la bombardearon; lo leí en los mismos periódicos que
propusieron a Inglaterra el enigma de que el sabio sinólogo Stephen Albert muriera
asesinado por un desconocido, Yá Tsun. El jefe ha descifrado ese enigma. Sabe que mi
problema era indicar (a través del estrépito de la guerra) la ciudad que se llama Albert y
que no hallé otro medio que matar a una persona de ese nombre. No sabe (nadie puede
saber) mi innumerable contrición y cansancio.&laquo;</p>
