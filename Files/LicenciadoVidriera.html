			<p><span class="char">Two students</span> were one day passing along the banks of the <span class="place">Tormes</span>, when they found <span class="char">a boy</span>, about eleven 
years old, dressed as a labourer, and sleeping under a tree. They sent a servant to wake him, and 
when he had well opened his eyes, they asked him whence he came, and what he was doing, to be lying 
asleep and defenceless in that lonely place. The boy replied, that he had forgotten the name of his 
birthplace, but was going to <span class="place">Salamanca</span>, there to seek a master whom he might serve, on condition of 
being permitted and aided to pursue his studies.</p>

<p>The gentlemen then asked if he could read, and he replied that he could, and write also.</p>

<p>"It is not from want of memory, then, that you have forgotten the name of your country," remarked 
the students.</p>

<p>"Let the cause be what it may," replied the boy, "neither that nor the name of my parents shall be 
known to any one until I can do honour to them both."</p>

<p>"But in what manner do you propose to do them honour?" inquired the gentlemen.</p>

<p>"By the results of my studies," said the boy, "and when I have rendered myself famous by the 
learning I mean to acquire; for I have heard that some men have made themselves bishops by their 
studies."</p>

<p>This reply moved the <span class="char">two gentlemen</span> to receive <span class="char">the lad</span> into their service, and take him with them 
to <span class="place">Salamanca</span>, giving him such facilities for studying as it is not unusual for masters to afford 
in that university to those who serve them.</p>

<p>The youth subsequently informed his masters, that they might call him <span class="char">Thomas Rodaja</span>; whence the 
students judged him to be the son of some poor labourer. A day or two after their meeting, they 
caused him to be clothed in a suit of black; and, in the course of a few weeks, he gave proof of 
extraordinary talent. He was, besides, very grateful, and laboured so earnestly in the service of 
his masters, that although in fact exceedingly attentive to his studies, it might well have been 
thought that he did nothing but wait upon those he served.</p>

<p>Now the good service of the valet led the masters to treat him well; <span class="char">Thomas</span> soon became their 
companion rather than servant, and, during eight years, all of which he passed with them, he 
acquired for himself so high a reputation in the university, by his great ability and excellent 
conduct, that he was beloved and esteemed by those of every rank.</p>

<p>The principal object of <span class="char">Rodaja</span>'s study was the law, but he was almost equally distinguished in 
polite learning, and his memory was matter of marvel to all; and the correctness of his views 
on all subjects was not less remarkable.</p>

<p>The time had now arrived when the studies of his masters were completed, and they returned to 
their birthplace, which was one of the most important cities of <span class="place">Andalusia</span>. They took <span class="char">Rodaja</span> with 
them, and he remained in their company for some time; but, assailed by a perpetual longing to 
return to his studies at <span class="place">Salamanca</span>,--a city that enchains the will of all who have tasted the 
amenities of life in that fair seat of learning--he entreated permission of his masters to 
depart for that purpose. With their usual kindness, they accorded him the favour he desired, 
and took such measures in his behalf that by their bounty he was supplied with a sufficiency to 
support him in the university for three years.</p>

<p><span class="char">Rodaja</span> took his leave with manifest proofs of gratitude, and departed from <span class="place">Malaga</span>, for that was 
the native city of his masters, without further delay. Descending the declivity of the Zambra on 
the road to <span class="place">Antequera</span>, he chanced to encounter <span class="char">a gentleman</span> on horseback, gaily accoutred in a rich 
travelling dress, and attended by <span class="char">two servants</span>, also on horseback, whose company he joined; their 
journey thenceforward lay in the same direction, and the gentleman accepted <span class="char">Thomas</span> as his comrade. 
They discoursed of various matters, and, in a short time, <span class="char">Rodaja</span> gave such proof of his quality 
as much delighted his fellow-traveller; while the latter, on his part, soon proved himself to be 
a kind and courteous man. He told <span class="char">Rodaja</span> that he was a captain of infantry in the service of the 
king, and that his ensign was then completing their company at <span class="place">Salamanca</span>. He praised the life of 
a soldier in the highest terms, describing, with much encomium, the many cities and other places 
visited by those who lead that life. Among other themes of which he spoke were the beauty of <span class="place">Naples</span>, 
the feasting and pleasures of <span class="place">Palermo</span>, the rich abundance of <span class="place">Milan</span>, and the frequent festivals 
held in other parts of <span class="place">Lombardy</span>--not omitting the good cheer of the numerous hostelries--in the 
description of which he broke forth rapturously in the Tuscan language, discoursing of Macarela, 
Macarroni, and Polastri, with the most cordial goodwill. He expatiated largely on the free 
enjoyment of life in <span class="place">Italy</span>, and on the pleasures of the soldier's life in general, which he 
exalted to the skies; but he did not say a word of the chilling night-watch, the perils of the 
assault, the terrors of battle, the hunger and privation endured in blockades and sieges, or the 
ruin caused by mines, with other matters of similar kind whereof he might have spoken, but which 
he passed over in silence--although there are those who would consider such things as having 
something to do with the life of the soldier, not to call them its principal features. In a word, 
he said so much on the subject, that the resolution of our <span class="char">Thomas Rodaja</span> began to waver, and his 
inclination went near to fix itself on that life, which is so near a neighbour to death.</p>

<p>The captain, whose name was <span class="char">Don Diego de Valdivia</span>, charmed, on his part, with the handsome looks, 
cheerful manners, and admirable abilities of <span class="char">Rodaja</span>, entreated him to accompany the march into 
<span class="place">Italy</span>, were it only for the purpose of seeing the country. He offered him his table, and even, 
if he would adopt the military life, he proposed to procure him a pair of colours; nay, he assured 
him that those of his own regiment would soon be vacant, and should be at his service.</p>

<p>But little persuasion was required to induce <span class="char">Rodaja</span>'s acceptance of a part of this offer. Weighing 
it in his mind, he considered that it would be well to see <span class="place">Italy</span> and <span class="place">Flanders</span>, to say nothing of 
other countries, since travel contributes to increase knowledge and discretion. He thought, too, 
that although he should spend three, or even four years in that occupation, yet these, added to 
the few he then counted, would not make him so old but that he might afterwards return to his 
studies. These and other considerations had their weight, and the opportunity being so much to 
his taste, <span class="char">Rodaja</span> finally told <span class="char">the captain</span> that he would go with him into <span class="place">Italy</span>; but it must be 
on condition of being left at perfect liberty. He would not consent to enlist under his banner, 
nor to have his name enrolled in the books of the regiment, that he might not be subjected to 
the restraints of service. <span class="char">The captain</span> represented that his being inscribed on the lists was a 
matter which involved no duty, and that he would thereby obtain all the appointments, with the 
regular pay accorded to his rank; while he, <span class="char">Don Diego</span>, would take care that he should have 
leave of absence whenever he might demand it. Yet <span class="char">Rodaja</span> was not to be moved from his 
determination. "For this," said he, "would be to act against the dictates of my conscience 
and of yours, <span class="char">señor captain</span>; I would, besides, much rather go free than be attached to 
military service in any manner."</p>

<p>"A conscience so scrupulous is more suitable to the cowl of a monk than the helmet of a 
soldier," said <span class="char">Don Diego</span>, laughing; "but let it be as you will, so we but remain comrades."</p>

<p>The first night of their journey they had passed at <span class="place">Antequera</span>, and making long stages each 
day, they speedily arrived at the place where <span class="char">the captain</span> was to join his company. All 
arrangements being completed, the company began its march with four others to <span class="place">Carthagena</span>, 
quartering at such places as fell in their way.</p>

<p>And now <span class="char">Rodaja</span> could not fail to remark the authority assumed by <span class="char">the commissaries</span>; the 
intractable character of many among <span class="char">the captains</span>; the rapacity of <span class="char">the quartermasters</span>, 
and the unreasonable nature of their demands; the fashion in which <span class="char">the paymasters</span> managed 
their accounts; the complaints of the people; the traffic in and exchange of billets; the 
insolence of the undisciplined troops; their quarrels with the other guests at the inns; the 
requisition of more rations and other stores than were rightful or necessary; and, finally, the 
almost inevitable consequences of all this. Much besides came under his observation, which he 
could not but see to be in every way wrong and injurious.</p>

<p>For <span class="char">Rodaja</span> himself, he had now abandoned the garb of a student, and dressed himself parrot-fashion 
(as we say), conforming to such things as the life around him presented. The many books he had 
possessed were now reduced to the "Orisons of Our Lady," and a "Garcilaso without Comments," 
which he carried in two of his pockets.</p>

<p>The party with which he travelled arrived at <span class="place">Carthagena</span> much earlier than he desired, for the 
varied life he led was very pleasant, and each day brought something new and agreeable. At 
<span class="place">Carthagena</span> the troops embarked in four galleys for <span class="place">Naples</span>; and in his cabin, also, <span class="char">Rodaja</span> made 
many observations on the strange life passed in those maritime houses, where, for the most part, 
a man is devoured by vermin and destroyed by rats, vexed by the sailors, robbed by the galley-slaves, 
and tormented by the swell of the waters. He endured terrible fear from violent storms and tempests, 
more especially in the Gulf of Lyons, where they had two, by one of which they were cast on the 
<span class="place">Island of Corsica</span>, while the other drove them back upon <span class="place">Toulon</span>, in <span class="place">France</span>. At last, weary and 
half-drowned, they reached land in the darkness of the night, and with great difficulty 
arrived at the most peaceful and beautiful city of <span class="place">Genoa</span>.</p>

<p>Having disembarked, and hastily visited a church to return thanks for their safety, <span class="char">the 
captain</span> with all his comrades adjourned to a tavern, where they quickly forgot past storms 
and tempests in present rejoicing and feasting.</p>

<p>Here they learned to appreciate the respective merits of the different wines presented to them 
by their active and voluble host; the delicacy of Trebbiano, the fine body of Montefiascone, 
the purity of Asperino, the generous spirit of the wines from <span class="place">Candia</span> and <span class="place">Soma</span>, and the strength 
of those from <span class="place">the Cincovinas</span>, or Five Vineyards. Neither did they disregard the sweetness and 
amenity of the <span class="char">Señora Guarnacha</span>, or the rustic bloom of the Centola, not forgetting even in 
this bright array the humble Romanesco, which likewise came in for its meed of praise.</p>

<p>The host having passed in review all these and other wines, of many various qualities, 
offered besides to place before his guests, without having any recourse to magic, and 
not as one marks down places on a map, but in all their vivid reality, Madriga, Coca, 
Alacjos, and the imperial, rather than royal city--that favourite abode of the god of 
smiles--Ciudad Real. He furthermore offered Esquibias, Alanis, Cazalla, Guadalcanal, 
and Membrilla, without forgetting the wines of Ribadavia or of Descargamaria. At a word, 
the host offered and even gave them more wines than Bacchus himself could have stored in 
all his cellars.</p>

<p>Nor was the good <span class="char">Thomas</span> unmindful of the admiration due to the radiant locks of <span class="char">the Genoese 
maidens</span>, renowned for those fair tresses, while he likewise appreciated the obliging and 
cheerful disposition of the male inhabitants, and was never weary of expatiating on the 
beauty of the city itself, which, as you look at it from the sea, appears to hold the houses 
enchased amidst the rocks, as diamonds are set in gold.</p>

<p>The day after their arrival, such of the companies as were destined for <span class="place">Piedmont</span> were disembarked; 
<span class="char">Rodaja</span>, however, had no wish to proceed thither, but determined to go from <span class="place">Genoa</span> by land to <span class="place">Rome</span> 
and <span class="place">Naples</span>, and return by the way of <span class="place">Our Lady of Loretto</span> to the great and magnificent <span class="place">Venice</span>, and 
thence to <span class="place">Milan</span> and <span class="place">Piedmont</span>, where it was agreed that he should rejoin <span class="place">Don Diego</span>, if the latter 
had not previously been compelled to set off for <span class="place">Flanders</span>, as was expected.</p>

<p>Two days after these arrangements were made, <span class="char">Rodaja</span> took leave of <span class="char">the captain</span>, and in five days 
from that time he reached <span class="place">Florence</span>, having first seen <span class="place">Lucca</span>, a city which is small but very well 
built, and one where Spaniards are more kindly received and better treated than in any other part 
of <span class="place">Italy</span>.</p>

<p>With <span class="char">Florence</span> <span class="char">Rodaja</span> was infinitely delighted, as well for the pleasantness of its position as for 
its sumptuous buildings, its fine river, agreeable streets, and cleanliness of aspect. He remained 
there but four days, and then departed for <span class="place">Rome</span>, the queen of cities and mistress of the world, 
whose temples he visited, whose relics he adored, and whose grandeur he admired: and as from the 
claws of the lion you may judge of its mass and force, so did <span class="char">Rodaja</span> infer the greatness of <span class="place">Rome</span> 
from the fragments of her marbles--her statues, broken or entire--her arches, fallen or fractured--her 
baths, crumbled to ruin--her magnificent porticos and vast amphitheatres--her renowned and holy river, 
which ever fills the banks with water to the brim, while it blesses them with innumerable remains of 
the martyrs whose bodies have found a burial beneath its waves. Nor did our traveller fail to estimate 
the beauty of the bridges, which one might fancy to be admiring each other, or the streets, which, 
by their very names alone, claim authority and pre-eminence over those of all other cities in the 
world: the <span class="place">Via Flaminia</span>, for example, the <span class="place">Via Julia</span>, <span class="place">the Appia</span>, and others of the same character.</p>

<p>No less was <span class="char">Rodaja</span> satisfied with the division of those hills which exist within the city itself, 
<span class="place">the Caelian</span>, <span class="place">the Quirinal</span>, <span class="place">the Vatican</span>, and the other four, whose very names bear evidence to the 
Roman greatness and majesty. He took careful note, moreover, of that authority which attaches to 
the College of Cardinals, and of the dignity represented in the person of the Supreme Pontiff; nor 
did he suffer to pass unnoticed that great concourse and variety of men from all nations ever 
congregated within the walls of the city.</p>

<p>All these things <span class="char">Rodaja</span> admired, reflected on, and arranged in the order of their importance; 
and having made the station of the Seven Churches, confessed to a Penitentiary, and kissed the 
feet of his Holiness, he departed, well loaded with Agnus Deis and legends, determining thence 
to proceed to <span class="place">Naples</span>.</p>

<p>But the time was one of important changes and much disorder; this rendered the roads dangerous 
for all desiring to enter or travel out of <span class="place">Rome</span>; and as he had come to the city by land, so he 
now resolved to depart by sea, wherefore, proceeding to <span class="place">the port of Ostia</span>, he there embarked, 
and having reached <span class="place">Naples</span>, added to the satisfaction which he had previously felt at seeing <span class="place">Rome</span>, 
that of finding himself in a city, in his estimation, and in the opinion of all who have seen it, 
the finest in <span class="place">Europe</span>, or even in the whole world.</p>

<p>From <span class="place">Naples</span>, <span class="char">Rodaja</span> proceeded to <span class="place">Sicily</span>, where he visited <span class="place">Palermo</span> and <span class="place">Messina</span>; the first of these 
cities he admired for the advantages of its position and its beauty, and the second for the 
convenience of its port; while to the whole island he could not but offer the tribute of his 
praise for that abundance which causes it to be justly denominated the granary of all <span class="place">Italy</span>.</p>

<p>Returning from <span class="place">Sicily</span> to <span class="place">Naples</span> and <span class="place">Rome</span>, <span class="char">Rodaja</span> thence proceeded to <span class="place">Our Lady of Loretto</span>, in 
whose Holy Temple he could see neither walls nor partitions, since every part was covered with 
crutches, biers, shrouds, chains, padlocks, fetters, and locks of hair; with arms, hands, legs, 
or busts in wax, to say nothing of pictures and prints, all giving manifest indication of the 
mercies and favours innumerable which hundreds of men have received in that place from the hand 
of God, by the intercession of his Divine Mother, whose sacred Image (there preserved) He has 
been pleased to exalt and sanction by a vast number of miracles, which have been performed in 
recompense of the devotion of her votaries; for by them it is that the walls of her house have 
been adorned in the manner described.</p>

<p>Here <span class="char">Rodaja</span> beheld that very chamber of the Virgin, wherein was delivered the most stupendous 
embassy ever heard or witnessed by all the heavens, all the angels, and all the archangels, or 
other inhabitants of the everlasting abodes.</p>

<p>From this place our traveller proceeded to <span class="place">Ancona</span>, where he embarked and repaired to <span class="place">Venice</span>, a 
city which, had Columbus never appeared in the world, would certainly be still supposed to have 
no equal; but, by the favour of heaven, and thanks to the great Fernando Cortez who conquered 
<span class="place">Mexico</span>, the magnificent <span class="place">Venice</span> has now found a city that may be compared to herself. The streets 
of these two renowned capitals, which are almost wholly of water, make them the admiration and 
terror of all mankind--that of <span class="place">Europe</span> dominating the old world, and that of <span class="place">America</span> the new. For 
of the former it would appear that her riches are infinite, her position impregnable, her government 
most wise, the abundance of her products inexhaustible; in a word, she is herself, as a whole, 
and in all her parts, entirely worthy of that fame for greatness and majesty which has penetrated 
to all the regions of the world: the justice of the praise bestowed on <span class="place">Venice</span> is, besides, 
accredited by her renowned arsenal, wherein are constructed her potent galleys, with other 
vessels of which the number is not to be told.</p>

<p>To our curious traveller the delights and pastimes found in <span class="place">Venice</span> had almost proved fatal as 
those of Calypso, since they had nearly caused him to forget his first intentions. Yet when he 
had passed a month in that enchanting place, he found resolution to continue his journey, 
passing by <span class="place">Ferrara</span>, <span class="place">Parma</span>, and <span class="place">Placentia</span>, to <span class="place">Milan</span>, that workshop of Vulcan--that grudge 
and despair of <span class="place">France</span>--that superb city of which more wonders are reported than words can 
tell, her own grandeur being increased by that of her famous Temple, and by the marvellous 
abundance of all things necessary to human life that are to be found therein.</p>

<p>From <span class="place">Milan</span>, <span class="char">Rodaja</span> journeyed to <span class="place">Asti</span>, where he arrived in very good time, since the regiment 
of <span class="char">Don Diego</span> was to depart for <span class="place">Flanders</span> on the following day. He was received very kindly by 
his friend <span class="char">the captain</span>, with whom he passed into <span class="place">Flanders</span>, and arrived at <span class="place">Antwerp</span>, a city no 
less worthy of admiration than those which he had seen in <span class="place">Italy</span>. He visited <span class="place">Ghent</span> and <span class="place">Brussels</span> 
likewise, finding the whole country preparing to take arms, and well disposed to enter on the 
campaign of the following year.</p>

<p><span class="char">Rodaja</span> having now seen all that he had desired to behold, resolved to return to his native 
<span class="place">Spain</span>, and to the city of <span class="place">Salamanca</span>, there to complete his studies. He had no sooner determined 
than he instantly put his purpose into execution, to the great regret of his friend, who, 
finding him resolved to depart, entreated him at least to write him word of his safe arrival, 
and likewise of his future success. This <span class="char">Rodaja</span> promised to do, and then returned to <span class="place">Spain</span> 
through <span class="place">France</span>, but he did not see <span class="place">Paris</span>, which was at that time in arms. At length he 
arrived at <span class="place">Salamanca</span>, where he was well received by his friends, and with the facilities 
which they procured him, he continued his studies until he finally attained to the degree of 
doctor of laws.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that, about this time, there arrived in <span class="place">Salamanca</span> one of those ladies who belong 
to all the points of the compass; she was besides well furnished with devices of every colour. 
To the whistle and bird-call of this fowler there instantly came flocking all the birds of the 
place; nor was there a vade mecum who refrained from paying a visit to that gay decoy. Among 
the rest our <span class="char">Thomas</span> was informed that <span class="char">the Señora</span> said she had been in <span class="place">Italy</span> and <span class="place">Flanders</span> when he, 
to ascertain if he were acquainted with the dame, likewise paid her a visit. She, on her part, 
immediately fell in love with Rodaja, but he rejected her advances, and never approached her 
house but when led thither by others, and almost by force. Attending much more zealously to 
his studies than his amusements, he did not in any manner return her affection, even when 
she had made it known to him by the offer of her hand and all her possessions.</p>

<p>Seeing herself thus scorned, and perceiving that she could not bend the will of <span class="char">Rodaja</span> by 
ordinary means, the woman determined to seek others, which in her opinion would be more 
efficacious, and must, as she thought, ensure the desired effect. So, by the advice of <span class="char">a 
Morisca woman</span>, she took a Toledan quince, and in that fruit she gave him one of those 
contrivances called charms, thinking that she was thereby forcing him to love her; as 
if there were, in this world, herbs, enchantments, or words of power, sufficient to 
enchain the free-will of any creature. These things are called charms, but they are in 
fact poisons: and those who administer them are actual poisoners, as has been proved by 
sundry experiences.</p>

<p>In an unhappy moment <span class="char">Rodaja</span> ate the quince, but had scarcely done so when he began to tremble 
from head to foot as if struck by apoplexy, remaining many hours before he could be brought to 
himself. At the end of that time he partially recovered, but appeared to have become almost an 
idiot. He complained, with a stammering tongue and feeble voice, that a quince which he had 
eaten had poisoned him, and also found means to intimate by whom it had been given, when 
justice at once began to move in quest of the criminal; but she, perceiving the failure 
of her attempt, took care to hide herself, and never appeared again.</p>

<p>Six months did <span class="char">Thomas</span> remain confined to his bed; and during that time he not only became 
reduced to a skeleton, but seemed also to have lost the use of his faculties. Every remedy 
that could be thought of was tried in his behalf; but although the physicians succeeded in 
curing the physical malady, they could not remove that of the mind; so that when he was at 
last pronounced cured, <span class="quot">he was still afflicted with the strangest madness that was ever heard 
of among the many kinds by which humanity has been assailed. The unhappy man imagined that he 
was entirely made of glass; and, possessed with this idea, when any one approached him he 
would utter the most terrible outcries, begging and beseeching them not to come near him, 
or they would assuredly break him to pieces, as he was not like other men but entirely of 
glass from head to foot</span>.</p>

<p>In the hope of rousing him from this strange hallucination, many persons, without regard to 
his prayers and cries, threw themselves upon him and embraced him, bidding him observe that 
he was not broken for all that. But all they gained by this was to see the poor creature sink 
to the earth, uttering lamentable moans, and instantly fall into a fainting fit, from which 
he could not be recovered for several hours; nay, when he did recover, it was but to renew 
his complaints, from which he never desisted but to implore that such a misfortune might not 
be suffered to happen again.</p>

<p>He exhorted every one to speak to him from a great distance; declaring that on this condition 
they might ask him what they pleased, and that he could reply with all the more effect, now he 
was a man of glass and not of flesh and bones, <span class="quot">since glass, being a substance of more delicate 
subtlety, permits the soul to act with more promptitude and efficacy than it can be expected to 
do in the heavier body formed of mere earth</span>.</p>

<p>Certain persons then desiring to ascertain if what he had said were true, asked him many 
questions of great difficulty respecting various circumstances; to all these he replied with 
the utmost acuteness, insomuch that his answers awakened astonishment in the most learned 
professors of medicine and philosophy whom that university could boast. And well they might 
be amazed at seeing a man who was subject to so strange an hallucination as that of believing 
himself to be made of glass, still retain such extraordinary judgment on other points as to 
be capable of answering difficult questions with the marvellous propriety and truth which 
distinguished the replies of <span class="char">Rodaja</span>.</p>

<p>The poor man had often entreated that some case might be given to him wherein he might 
enclose the brittle vase of his body, so that he might not break it in putting on the 
ordinary clothing. He was consequently furnished with a surplice of ample width, and a 
cloth wrapper, which he folded around him with much care, confining it to his waist with a 
girdle of soft cotton, but he would not wear any kind of shoes. The method he adopted to 
prevent any one from approaching him when they brought him food, was to fix an earthen pot 
into the cleft of a stick prepared for that purpose, and in this vessel he would receive 
such fruits as the season presented. He would not eat flesh or fish; nor would he drink 
anything but the water of the river, which he lapped from his hands.</p>

<p>In passing through the streets, <span class="char">Rodaja</span> was in the habit of walking carefully in the middle 
of them, lest a tile should fall from the houses upon his head and break it. In the summer 
he slept in the open air, and in the winter he lodged at one of the inns, where he buried 
himself in straw to his throat, remarking that this was the most proper and secure bed for 
men of glass. When it thundered, <span class="char">Rodaja</span> trembled like an aspen leaf, and would rush out into 
the fields, not returning to the city until the storm had passed.</p>

<p>His friends kept him shut up for some time, but perceiving that his malady increased, they 
at last complied with his earnest request that they would let him go about freely; and he 
might be seen walking through the streets of the city, dressed as we have described, to the 
astonishment and regret of all who knew him.</p>

<p><span class="char">The boys</span> soon got about him, but he kept them off with his staff, requesting them to speak 
to him from a distance, lest they should break him, seeing that he, being a man of glass, 
was exceedingly tender and brittle. But far from listening to his request, the boys, who 
are the most perverse generation in the world, soon began to throw various missiles and 
even stones at him, notwithstanding all his prayers and exclamations. They declared that 
they wished to see if he were in truth of glass, as he affirmed; but the lamentations and 
outcries of the poor maniac induced the grown persons who were near to reprove and even 
beat the boys, whom they drove away for the moment, but who did not fail to return at the 
next opportunity.</p>

<p>One day, that a horde of these tormentors had pursued him with more than their usual 
pertinacity, and had worn out his patience, he turned to them, saying--"What do you 
want with me you varlets? more obstinate than flies, more disgusting than Chinches, 
and bolder than the boldest fleas. Am I, perchance, the Monte Testacio of <span class="place">Rome</span>, that you 
cast upon me so many potsherds and tiles?" But <span class="char">Rodaja</span> was followed by many who kept about him 
for the purpose of hearing him reply to the questions asked, or reprove the questioner, as the 
case might be. And after a time, even the boys found it more amusing to listen to his words 
than to throw tiles at him; when they gave him, for the most part, somewhat less annoyance.</p>

<p>The maniac <span class="char">Rodaja</span> was one day passing through <span class="place">the Ropery</span> at <span class="place">Salamanca</span>, when a woman who was 
working there accosted him, and said, "By my soul, <span class="char">Señor Doctor</span>, I am sorry for your misfortune, 
but what shall I do for you, since, try as I may, I cannot weep?" To which <span class="char">Rodaja</span>, fixedly 
regarding her, gravely replied, "Filiae Jerusalem, plorate super vos et super filios vestros." 
The husband of the ropeworker was standing by, and comprehending the reply, he said to <span class="char">Rodaja</span>, 
"Brother Glasscase, for so they tell me you are to be called, you have more of the rogue than 
the fool in you!" "You are not called on to give me an obolus," rejoined <span class="char">Rodaja</span>, "for I have 
not a grain of the fool about me!" One day that he was passing near a house well known as the 
resort of thieves and other disorderly persons, he saw several of the inhabitants assembled 
round the door, and called out, "See, here you have baggage belonging to the army of Satan, 
and it is lodged in the house of hell accordingly."</p>

<p>A man once asked him what advice he should give to a friend whose wife had left him for another, 
and who was in great sorrow for her loss. "You shall bid him thank God," replied <span class="char">Rodaja</span>, "for 
the favour he has obtained, in that his enemy is removed from his house."</p>

<p>"Then you would not have him go seek her?" inquired the other.</p>

<p>"Let him not even think of doing so," returned <span class="char">Rodaja</span>, "for if he find her, what will he 
have gained but the perpetual evidence of his dishonour?"</p>

<p>"And what shall I do to keep peace with my own wife?" inquired the same person.</p>

<p>"Give her all that she can need or rightfully claim," said the maniac, "and let her be mistress 
of every person and thing thy house contains, but take care that she be not mistress of thyself."</p>

<p>A boy one day said to him, "<span class="char">Señor Glasscase</span>, I have a mind to run away from my father, and leave 
my home for ever, because he beats me." "I would have thee beware, boy," replied <span class="char">Rodaja</span>; "the stripes 
given by a father are no dishonour to the son, and may save him from those of the hangman, which are 
indeed a disgrace."</p>

<p>Intelligence of his peculiar state, with a description of the replies he gave, and the remarks he 
uttered, was much spread abroad, more especially among those who had known him in different parts, 
and great sorrow was expressed for the loss of a man who had given so fair a promise of distinction. 
A person of high rank then at Court wrote to a friend of his at <span class="place">Salamanca</span>, begging that <span class="char">Rodaja</span> might 
be sent to him at <span class="place">Valladolid</span>, and charging his friend to make all needful arrangements for that purpose. 
The gentleman consequently accosted <span class="char">Vidriera</span> the next time he met him, and said, "<span class="char">Señor Glasscase</span>, you 
are to know that a great noble of the Court is anxious to have you go to <span class="place">Valladolid</span>;" whereupon Rodaja 
replied, "Your worship will excuse me to that nobleman, and say that I am not fit to dwell at Court, 
nor in the Palace, because I have some sense of shame left, and do not know how to flatter." He was 
nevertheless persuaded to go, and the mode in which he travelled was as follows: <span class="quot">a large pannier of 
that kind in which glass is transported was prepared, and in this Rodaja was placed, well defended 
by straw, which was brought up to his neck, the opposite pannier being carefully balanced by means 
of stones, among which appeared the necks of bottles, since Rodaja desired it to be understood that 
he was sent as a vessel of glass.</span> In this fashion he journeyed to Valladolid, which city he entered 
by night, and was not unpacked until he had first been carefully deposited in the house of the noble 
who had requested his presence.</p>

<p>By this <span class="char">gentleman</span> he was received with much kindness, and the latter said to him, "You are extremely 
welcome, <span class="char">Doctor Glasscase</span>; I hope you have had a pleasant journey." <span class="char">Rodaja</span> replied, that no journey 
could be called a bad one if it took you safe to your end, unless indeed it were that which led to the 
gallows.</p>

<p>Being one day shown the Falconry, wherein were numerous falcons and other birds of similar kind, he 
remarked that the sport pursued by means of those birds was entirely suitable to great nobles, since 
the cost was as two thousand to one of the profit.</p>

<p>When it pleased <span class="char">Rodaja</span> to go forth into the city, <span class="char">the nobleman</span> caused him to be attended by a servant, 
whose office it was to protect him from intrusion, and see that he was not molested by the boys of 
the place, by whom he was at once remarked; indeed but few days had elapsed before he became known 
to the whole city, since he never failed to find a reply for all who questioned or consulted him.</p>

<p>Among those of the former class, there once came <span class="char">a student</span>, who inquired if he were a poet, to which 
<span class="char">Rodaja</span> replied, that up to the moment they had then arrived at, he had neither been so stupid nor so 
bold as to become a poet. "I do not understand what you mean by so stupid or so bold, <span class="char">Señor Glasscase</span>," 
rejoined the student; to which <span class="char">Rodaja</span> made answer, "I am not so stupid as to be a bad poet, nor so bold 
as to think myself capable of being a good one." <span class="char">The student</span> then inquired in what estimation he held 
poets, to which he answered that he held the poets themselves in but little esteem; but as to their art, 
that he esteemed greatly. His hearer inquiring further what he meant by that, <span class="char">Rodaja</span> said that among the 
innumerable poets, by courtesy so called, the number of good ones was so small as scarcely to count at all, 
and that as the bad were not true poets, he could not admire them: but that he admired and even reverenced 
greatly the art of poetry, which does in fact comprise every other in itself, since it avails itself of 
all things, and purifies and beautifies all things, bringing its own marvellous productions to light for 
the advantage, the delectation, and the wonder of the world, which it fills with its benefits. He added 
further, "I know thoroughly to what extent, and for what qualities, we ought to estimate the good poet, 
since I perfectly well remember those verses of Ovid, wherein he says:--</p>

<blockquote>"'Cura ducum fuerunt olim regumque poetae,<br>
Praemiaque antiqui magna tulere chori.<br>
Sanctaque majestas, et erat venerabile nomen<br>
Vatibus; et largae saepe dabantur opes.'</blockquote>

<p>And still less do I forget the high quality of the poets whom Plato calls the interpreters of the Gods, 
while Ovid says of them--</p>

<blockquote>"'Est deus in nobis; agitante calescimus illo.'</blockquote>

<p>And again--</p>

<blockquote>"'At sacri vates et divum cura vocamur.'</blockquote>

<p>"These things are said of good poets; but, as respects the bad ones--the gabbling pretenders--what can 
we say, save only that they are the idiocy and the arrogance of the world.</p>

<p>"Who is there that has not seen one of this sort when he is longing to bring forth some sonnet to the 
ears of his neighbours? How he goes round and round them with--'Will your worships excuse me if I read 
you a little sonnet, which I made one night on a certain occasion; for it appears to me, although indeed 
it be worth nothing, to have yet a certain something--a je ne scai quoi of pretty, and pleasing.' Then shall 
he twist his lips, and arch his eyebrows, and make a thousand antics, diving into his pockets meanwhile and 
bringing out half a hundred scraps of paper, greasy and torn, as if he had made a good million of sonnets; 
he then recites that which he proffered to the company, reading it in a chanting and affected voice.</p>

<p>"If, perchance, those who hear him, whether because of their knowledge or their ignorance, should fail to 
commend him, he says, 'Either your worships have not listened to the verses, or I have not been able to 
read them properly, for indeed and in truth they deserve to be heard;' and he begins, as before, to 
recite his poem, with new gestures and varied pauses.</p>

<p>"Then to hear these poetasters censure and tear one another to pieces! And what shall I say of the thefts 
committed by these cubs and whelps of modern pretence on the grave and ancient masters of the art, or of 
their malevolent carpings at those excellent persons of their own day in whom shines the true light of 
poetry; who, making a solace and recreation of their arduous labours, prove the divinity of their genius 
and the elevation of their thoughts to the despite and vexation of these ignorant pretenders, who presume 
to judge that of which they know nothing, and abhor the beauties which they are not able to comprehend? 
What will you have me esteem in the nullity which seeks to find place for itself under the canopy spread 
for others--in the ignorance which is ever leaning for support on another man's chair?"</p>

<p><span class="char">Rodaja</span> was once asked how it happened that poets are always poor; to which he replied, "That if they 
were poor, it was because they chose to be so, since it was always in their power to be rich if they 
would only take advantage of the opportunities in their hands. For see how rich are their ladies," 
he added; "have they not all a very profusion of wealth in their possession? Is not their hair of gold, 
their brows of burnished silver, their eyes of the most precious jewels, their lips of coral, their 
throats of ivory and transparent crystal? Are not their tears liquid pearls, and where they plant 
the soles of their feet do not jasmine and roses spring up at the moment, however rebellious and 
sterile the earth may previously have been? Then what is their breath but pure amber, musk, and 
frankincense? Yet to whom do all these things belong, if not to the poets? They are, therefore, 
manifest signs and proofs of their great riches."</p>

<p>In this manner he always spoke of bad poets; as to the good ones, he was loud in their praise, and 
exalted them above the horns of the moon.</p>

<p>Being at San Francisco, he one day saw some very indifferent pictures, by an incapable hand; whereupon 
he remarked that the good painters imitate nature, while the bad ones have the impertinence to daub her face.</p>

<p>Having planted himself one day in front of a bookseller's shop with great care, to avoid being broken, he 
began to talk to the owner, and said, "This trade would please me greatly, were it not for one fault that 
it has." <span class="char">The bookseller</span> inquiring what that might be, <span class="char">Rodaja</span> replied, "It is the tricks you play on the 
writers when you purchase the copyright of a book, and the sport you make of the author if, perchance, 
he desire to print at his own cost. For what is your method of proceeding? Instead of the one thousand 
five hundred copies which you agree to print for him, you print three thousand; and when the author 
supposes that you are selling his books, you are but disposing of your own."</p>

<p>One of those men who carry sedan-chairs, once standing by while <span class="char">Rodaja</span> was <span class="quot">enumerating the faults 
committed by various trades and occupations</span>, remarked to the latter, "Of us, Señor Doctor, you can 
find nothing amiss to say." "Nothing," replied Rodaja, "except that you are made acquainted with more 
sins than are known to the confessor; but with this difference, that the confessor learns them to keep 
all secret, but you to make them the public talk of the taverns."</p>

<p><span class="char">A muleteer</span> who heard this, for all kinds of people were continually listening to him, said aloud, "There 
is little or nothing that you can say of us, <span class="char">Señor Phial</span>, for we are people of great worth, and very 
useful servants to the commonwealth." To which <span class="char">the man of glass</span> replied, "The honour of the master 
exalts the honour of the servant. You, therefore, who call those who hire your mules your masters, 
see whom you serve, and what honour you may borrow from them; for your employers are some of the dirtiest 
rubbish that this earth endures.</p>

<p>"Once, when I was not a man of glass, I was travelling on a mule which I had hired, and I counted in her 
master one hundred and twenty-one defects, all capital ones, and all enemies to the human kind. All 
muleteers have a touch of the ruffian, a spice of the thief, and a dash of the mountebank. If their 
masters, as they call those they take on their mules, be of the butter-mouthed kind, they play more 
pranks with them than all the rogues of this city could perform in a year. If they be strangers, the 
muleteers rob them; if students, they malign them; if monks, they blaspheme them; but if soldiers, 
they tremble before them. These men, with the sailors, the carters, and the arrieros or pack carriers, 
lead a sort of life which is truly singular, and belongs to themselves alone.</p>

<p>"The carter passes the greater part of his days in a space not more than a yard and a half long, for 
there cannot be much more between the yoke of his mules and the mouth of his cart. He is singing for 
one half of his time, and blaspheming the other; and if he have to drag one of his wheels out of a 
hole in the mire, he is more aided, as it might seem, by two great oaths than by three strong mules.</p>

<p>"The mariners are a pleasant people, but little like those of the towns, and they can speak no other 
language than that used in ships. When the weather is fine they are very diligent, but very idle, 
when it is stormy. During the tempest they order much and obey little. Their ship, which is their 
mess-room, is also their god, and their pastime is the torment endured by sea-sick passengers.</p>

<p>"As to the mule-carriers, they are a race which has taken out a divorce from all sheets, and has 
married the pack-saddle. So diligent and careful are these excellent men, that to save themselves 
from losing a day, they will lose their souls. Their music is the tramp of a hoof; their sauce is 
hunger; their matins are an exchange of abuse and bad words; their mass is--to hear none at all."</p>

<p>While speaking thus, Rodaja stood at an apothecary's door, and turning to the master of the shop, 
he said, "Your worship's occupation would be a most salutary one if it were not so great an enemy 
to your lamps."</p>

<p>"Wherein is my trade an enemy to my lamps?" asked the apothecary.</p>

<p>"In this way," replied Rodaja; "whenever other oils fail you, immediately you take that of the lamp, 
as being the one which most readily comes to hand. But there is, indeed, another fault in your trade, 
and one that would suffice to ruin the most accredited physician in the world." Being asked what that 
was, he replied that an apothecary never ventured to confess, or would admit, that any drug was absent 
from his stock; and so, if he have not the medicine prescribed, he makes use of some other which, in his 
opinion, has the same virtues and qualities; but as that is very seldom the case, the medicine, being 
badly compounded, produces an effect contrary to that expected by the physician.</p>

<p><span class="char">Rodaja</span> was then asked what he though, of the physicians themselves, and he replied as follows: "Honora 
medicum propter necessitatem, etenim creavit cum altissimus: à Deo enim est omnis medela, et a rege 
accipiet donationem: disciplina medici exaltavit caput illius, et in conspectu magnatum collaudabitur. 
Altissimus de terra creavit medicinam, et vir prudens non abhorrebit illam. Thus," he added, "speaketh 
the Book of Ecclesiasticus, of Medicine, and good Physicians; but of the bad ones we may safely affirm 
the very contrary, since there are no people more injurious to the commonwealth than they are. The judge 
may distort or delay the justice which he should render us; the lawyer may support an unjust demand; the 
merchant may help us to squander our estate, and, in a word, all those with whom we have to deal in common 
life may do us more or less injury; but to kill us without fear and standing quietly at his ease; 
unsheathing no other sword than that wrapped in the folds of a recipe, and without being subject to any 
danger of punishment, that can be done only by the physician; he alone can escape all fear of the discovery 
of his crimes, because at the moment of committing them he puts them under the earth. When I was a man of 
flesh, and not of glass, as I now am, I saw many things that might be adduced in support of what I have now 
said, but the relation of these I refer to some other time."</p>

<p>A certain person asked him what he should do to avoid envying another, and <span class="char">Rodaja</span> bade him go to sleep, 
for, said he, "While you sleep you will be the equal of him whom you envy."</p>

<p>It happened on a certain occasion that <span class="char">the Criminal Judge</span> passed before the place where <span class="char">Rodaja</span> stood. 
There was a great crowd of people, and <span class="char">two alguazils</span> attended <span class="char">the magistrate</span>, who was proceeding to 
his court, when <span class="char">Rodaja</span> inquired his name. Being told, he replied, "Now, I would lay a wager that this 
judge has vipers in his bosom, pistols in his inkhorn, and flashes of lightning in his hands, to 
destroy all that shall come within his commission. I once had a friend who inflicted so exorbitant 
a sentence in respect to a criminal commission which he held, that it exceeded by many carats the 
amount of guilt incurred by the crime of the delinquents. I inquired of him wherefore he had 
uttered so cruel a sentence, and committed so manifest an injustice? To which he replied that 
he intended to grant permission of appeal, and that in this way he left the field open for the 
Lords of the Council to show their mercy by moderating and reducing that too rigorous punishment 
to its due proportions. But I told him it would have been still better for him to have given such 
a sentence as would have rendered their labour unnecessary, by which means he would also have 
merited and obtained the reputation of being a wise and exact judge."</p>

<p>Among the number of those by whom <span class="char">Rodaja</span>, as I have said, was constantly surrounded, was an 
acquaintance of his own, who permitted himself to be saluted as the <span class="char">Señor Doctor</span>, although <span class="char">Thomas</span> 
knew well that he had not taken even the degree of bachelor. To him, therefore, he one day said, 
"Take care, gossip mine, that you and your title do not meet with the Fathers of the Redemption, 
for they will certainly take possession of your doctorship as being a creature unrighteously detained 
captive."</p>

<p>"Let us behave well to each other, <span class="char">Señor Glasscase</span>," said the other, "since you know that I am a man of 
high and profound learning."</p>

<p>"I know you rather to be a Tantalus in the same," replied <span class="char">Rodaja</span>; "for if learning reach high to you, 
you are never able to plunge into its depths."</p>

<p>He was one day leaning against the stall of <span class="char">a tailor</span>, who was seated with his hands before him, and to 
whom he said--</p>

<p>"Without doubt, Señor Maeso, you are in the way to salvation."</p>

<p>"From what symptom do you judge me to be so, <span class="char">Señor Doctor</span>?" inquired the tailor.</p>

<p>"From the fact that, as you have nothing to do, so you have nothing to lie about, and may cease 
lying, which is a great step."</p>

<p>Of <span class="char">the shoemakers</span> he said, that not one of that trade ever performed his office badly; seeing that 
if the shoe be too narrow, and pinches the foot, the shoemaker says, "In two hours it will be as wide 
as an alpargate;" or he declares it right that it should be narrow, since the shoe of a gentleman must 
needs fit closely; and if it be too wide, he maintains that it still ought to be so, for the ease of 
the foot, and lest a man should have the gout.</p>

<p>Seeing the waiting-maid of <span class="char">an actress</span> attending her mistress, he said she was much to be pitied who 
had to serve so many women, to say nothing of the men whom she also had to wait on; and the bystanders 
requiring to know how the damsel, who had but to serve one, could be said to wait on so many, he replied, 
"Is she not the waiting-maid of a queen, a nymph, a goddess, a scullery-maid, and a shepherdess? besides 
that she is also the servant of a page and a lackey? for all these, and many more, are in the person of an actress."</p>

<p>Some one asked <span class="char">Rodaja</span>, who had been the happiest man in the world? To which he answered--"Nemo, seeing 
that Nemo novit patrem--Nemo sine crimine vivit--Nemo sua sorte contentus--Nemo ascendit in coelum," &c. &c.</p>

<p>Of <span class="char">the fencing masters</span> he said, that they were professors of an art which was never to be known when it 
was most wanted, since they pretended to reduce to mathematical demonstrations, which are infallible, the 
angry thoughts and movements of a man's adversaries.</p>

<p>To such men as dyed their beards, Rodaja always exhibited a particular enmity; and one day observing <span class="char">a 
Portuguese</span>, whose beard he knew to be dyed, in dispute with a Spaniard, to whom he said, "I swear by the 
beard that I wear on my face," <span class="char">Rodaja</span> called out to him, "Halt there, friend; you should not say that you 
wear on your face, but that you dye on your face." To another, whose beard had been streaked by an 
imperfect dye, <span class="char">Doctor Glasscase</span> said, "Your beard is of the true dust-coloured pieball." He related, on 
another occasion, that a certain damsel, discreetly conforming to the will of her parents, had agreed to 
marry an old man with a white beard, who, on the evening before his marriage was to take place, thought 
fit to have his beard dyed, and whereas he had taken it from the sight of his betrothed as white as snow, 
he presented it at the altar with a colour blacker than that of pitch.</p>

<p>Seeing this, <span class="char">the damsel</span> turned to her parents and requested them to give her the spouse they had promised, 
saying that she would have him, and no other.</p>

<p>They assured her, that he whom she there saw was the person they had before shewn her, and given her for 
her spouse: but she refused to believe it, maintaining, that he whom her parents had given her was a grave 
person, with a white beard: nor was she, by any means, to be persuaded that the dyed man before her was her 
betrothed, and the marriage was broken off.</p>

<p>Towards <span class="char">Duennas</span> he entertained as great a dislike as towards those who dyed their beards--uttering wonderful 
things respecting their falsehood and affectation, their tricks and pretences, their simulated scruples 
and their real wickedness,--reproaching them with their fancied maladies of stomach, and the frequent 
giddiness with which they were afflicted in the head; nay, even their mode of speaking, was made the 
subject of his censure; and he declared that there were more turns in their speech than folds in 
their great togas and wide gowns; finally, he declared them altogether useless, if not much worse.</p>

<p><span class="quot">Being one day much tormented by a hornet which settled on his neck, he nevertheless refused to take 
it off, lest in seeking to catch the insect he should break himself; but he still complained woefully 
of the sting.</span> Some one then remarked to him, that it was scarcely to be supposed he would feel it much, 
since his whole person was of glass. But <span class="char">Rodaja</span> replied, that the hornet in question must needs be a 
slanderer, seeing that slanderers were of a race whose tongues were capable of penetrating bodies of bronze, 
to say nothing of glass.</p>

<p><span class="char">A monk</span>, who was enormously fat, one day passed near where <span class="char">Rodaja</span> was sitting, when one who stood by ironically 
remarked, that <span class="char">the father</span> was so reduced and consumptive, as scarcely to be capable of walking. Offended by 
this, <span class="char">Rodaja</span> exclaimed, "Let none forget the words of Holy Scripture, 'Nolite tangere Christos meos;' and, 
becoming still more heated, he bade those around him reflect a little, when they would see, that of the 
many saints canonised, and placed among the number of the blessed by the Church within a few years in 
those parts, none had been called the Captain Don Such a one, or the Lawyer Don So and So, or the Count 
Marquis, or Duke of Such a Place; but all were brother Diego, brother Jacinto, or brother Raimundo: all 
monks and friars, proceeding, that is to say, from the monastic orders." "These," he added, "are the 
orange-trees of heaven, whose fruits are placed on the table of God." Of evil-speakers Rodaja said, 
that they were like the feathers of the eagle which gnaw, wear away, and reduce to nothing, whatever 
feathers of other birds are mingled with them in beds or cushions, how good soever those feathers may be.</p>

<p>Concerning the keepers of gaming-houses he uttered wonders, and many more than can here be repeated--commending 
highly the patience of a certain gamester, who would remain all night playing and losing; yea, though of 
choleric disposition by nature, he would never open his mouth to complain, although he was suffering the 
martyrdom of Barabbas, provided only his adversary did not cut the cards. <span class="quot">At a word, Rodaja uttered so 
many sage remarks, that, had it not been for the cries he sent forth when any one approached near enough 
to touch him, for his peculiar dress, slight food, strange manner of eating, and sleeping in the air, 
or buried in straw, as we have related, no one could have supposed but that he was one of the most 
acute persons in the world.</span></p>

<p>He remained more than two years in this condition; but, at the end of that time, <span class="char">a monk</span> of the order of 
St. Jerome, who had extraordinary powers in the cure of lunacy, nay, who even made deaf and dumb people 
hear and speak in a certain manner; this monk, I say, undertook the care and cure of <span class="char">Rodaja</span>, being moved 
thereto by the charity of his disposition. Nor was it long before the lunatic was restored to his 
original state of judgment and understanding. When the cure was effected, the monk presented his 
patient with his previous dress of a doctor of laws, exhorting him to return to his earlier mode 
of life, and assuring him that he might now render himself as remarkable for the force of his 
intellect, as he had before done for his singular folly.</p>

<p><span class="char">Thomas</span> returned accordingly to his past pursuits; but, instead of calling himself <span class="char">Rodaja</span>, as before, 
he assumed the name of <span class="char">Rueda</span>. He had scarcely appeared in the street, before he was recognised by <span class="char">the 
boys</span>; but seeing him in a dress so different from that he had before worn and been known by, they 
dared not cry after him or ask him questions, but contented themselves with saying, one to another, 
"Is not this <span class="char">the madman</span>, <span class="char">Doctor Glasscase</span>? It is certainly he; and though he now looks so discreet, 
he may be just as mad in this handsome dress as he was in that other. Let us ask him some questions, 
and get rid of our doubts."</p>

<p>All this was heard by <span class="char">Thomas</span>, who maintained silence, but felt much confused, and hurried along more 
hastily than he had been wont to do before he regained his senses. The men at length made the same 
remarks as <span class="char">the boys</span> and before he had arrived at the courts he had a train of more than two hundred 
persons of all classes following him, being more amply attended than the most popular professor of the 
university.</p>

<p>Having gained the first court, which is that of the entrance, these people ended by surrounding him 
completely; when, perceiving that he was so crowded on as no longer to have the power of proceeding, 
he finally raised his voice, and said--</p>

<p>"Señores, it is true that I am <span class="char">Doctor Glass-case</span>, but not he whom you formerly knew. I am now <span class="char">Doctor Rueda</span>. 
Misfortunes such as not unfrequently happen in this world, by the permission of heaven, had deprived me of 
my senses, but the mercy of God has restored them; and by those things which you have heard me say when I 
was mad, you may judge of what I shall say now that I am become sane. I am a doctor in laws of the university 
of <span class="place">Salamanca</span>, where I studied in much poverty, but raised myself through all the degrees to that I now hold; 
but my poverty may serve to assure you that I owe my rank to industry and not to favour. I have come to this 
great sea of the Court, hoping to swim and get forward and gain the bread of my life; but if you do not leave 
me I shall be more likely to sink and find my death. For the love of God, I entreat that you follow me no 
further, since, in doing so, you persecute and injure me. What you formerly enquired of me in the streets, 
I beg you now to come and ask me at my house, when you shall see that the questions to which I before replied, 
impromptu, shall be more perfectly answered now that I shall take time to consider.</p>

<p>All listened to him, many left him as he desired, and he returned to his abode with a much smaller train. But 
it was every day the same: his exhortations availed nothing; and <span class="char">Thomas</span> finally resolved to repair to <span class="place">Flanders</span>, 
there to support himself by the strength of his arm, since he could no longer profit by that of his intellect.</p>

<p>This resolution he executed accordingly, exclaiming as he departed--<span class="quot">"Oh, city and court! you by whom the 
expectations of the bold pretender are fulfilled, while the hopes of the modest labourer are destroyed; 
you who abundantly sustain the shameless Buffoon, while the worthy sage is left to die of hunger; I bid you 
farewell."</span> That said, he proceeded to <span class="place">Flanders</span>, where he finished in arms the life which he might have 
rendered immortal by letters, and died in the company of his friend <span class="char">the Captain Don Diego</span>, leaving 
behind him the reputation of a most valiant soldier and upright man.</p>

			<p>Paseándose dos caballeros estudiantes por las riberas de Tormes, hallaron en ellas, debajo 
de un árbol durmiendo, a un muchacho de hasta edad de once años, vestido como labrador. 
Mandaron a un criado que le despertase; despertó y preguntáronle de adónde era y qué 
hacía durmiendo en aquella soledad. A lo cual el muchacho respondió que el nombre de su 
tierra se le había olvidado, y que iba a la ciudad de Salamanca a buscar un amo a quien 
servir, por sólo que le diese estudio. Preguntáronle si sabía leer; respondió que sí, y escribir 
también.</p> 

<p>-Desa manera -dijo uno de los caballeros-, no es por falta de memoria habérsete olvidado el 
nombre de tu patria.</p> 

<p>-Sea por lo que fuere -respondió el muchacho-; que ni el della ni del de mis padres sabrá 
ninguno hasta que yo pueda honrarlos a ellos y a ella.</p> 

<p>-Pues, ¿de qué suerte los piensas honrar? -preguntó el otro caballero.</p>
 
<p>-Con mis estudios -respondió el muchacho-, siendo famoso por ellos; porque yo he oído 
decir que de los hombres se hacen los obispos.</p> 

<p>Esta respuesta movió a los dos caballeros a que le recibiesen y llevasen consigo, como lo 
hicieron, dándole estudio de la manera que se usa dar en aquella universidad a los criados 
que sirven. Dijo el muchacho que se llamaba Tomás Rodaja, de donde infirieron sus amos, 
por el nombre y por el vestido, que debía de ser hijo de algún labrador pobre. A pocos días 
le vistieron de negro, y a pocas semanas dio Tomás muestras de tener raro ingenio, 
sirviendo a sus amos con tanta fidelidad, puntualidad y diligencia que, con no faltar un 
punto a sus estudios, parecía que sólo se ocupaba en servirlos. Y, como el buen servir del 
siervo mueve la voluntad del señor a tratarle bien, ya Tomás Rodaja no era criado de sus 
amos, sino su compañero.</p> 

<p>Finalmente, en ocho años que estuvo con ellos, se hizo tan famoso en la universidad, por su 
buen ingenio y notable habilidad, que de todo género de gentes era estimado y querido. Su 
principal estudio fue de leyes; pero en lo que más se mostraba era en letras humanas; y 
tenía tan felice memoria que era cosa de espanto, e ilustrábala tanto con su buen 
entendimiento, que no era menos famoso por él que por ella.</p> 

<p>Sucedió que se llegó el tiempo que sus amos acabaron sus estudios y se fueron a su lugar, 
que era una de las mejores ciudades de la Andalucía. Lleváronse consigo a Tomás, y estuvo 
con ellos algunos días; pero, como le fatigasen los deseos de volver a sus estudios y a 
Salamanca (que enhechiza la voluntad de volver a ella a todos los que de la apacibilidad de 
su vivienda han gustado), pidió a sus amos licencia para volverse. Ellos, corteses y 
liberales, se la dieron, acomodándole de suerte que con lo que le dieron se pudiera sustentar 
tres años.</p> 

<p>Despidióse dellos, mostrando en sus palabras su agradecimiento, y salió de Málaga (que 
ésta era la patria de sus señores); y, al bajar de la cuesta de la Zambra, camino de 
Antequera, se topó con un gentilhombre a caballo, vestido bizarramente de camino, con dos 
criados también a caballo. Juntóse con él y supo cómo llevaba su mismo viaje. Hicieron 
camarada, departieron de diversas cosas, y a pocos lances dio Tomás muestras de su raro 
ingenio, y el caballero las dio de su bizarría y cortesano trato, y dijo que era capitán de 
infantería por Su Majestad, y que su alférez estaba haciendo la compañía en tierra de 
Salamanca.</p> 

<p>Alabó la vida de la soldadesca; pintóle muy al vivo la belleza de la ciudad de Nápoles, las 
holguras de Palermo, la abundancia de Milán, los festines de Lombardía, las espléndidas 
comidas de las hosterías; dibujóle dulce y puntualmente el aconcha, patrón; pasa acá, 
manigoldo; venga la macarela, li polastri e li macarroni. Puso las alabanzas en el cielo de la 
vida libre del soldado y de la libertad de Italia; pero no le dijo nada del frío de las 
centinelas, del peligro de los asaltos, del espanto de las batallas, de la hambre de los cercos, 
de la ruina de la minas, con otras cosas deste jaez, que algunos las toman y tienen por 
añadiduras del peso de la soldadesca, y son la carga principal della. En resolución, tantas 
cosas le dijo, y tan bien dichas, que la discreción de nuestro Tomás Rodaja comenzó a 
titubear y la voluntad a aficionarse a aquella vida, que tan cerca tiene la muerte.</p> 

<p>El capitán, que don Diego de Valdivia se llamaba, contentísimo de la buena presencia, 
ingenio y desenvoltura de Tomás, le rogó que se fuese con él a Italia, si quería, por 
curiosidad de verla; que él le ofrecía su mesa y aun, si fuese necesario, su bandera, porque 
su alférez la había de dejar presto.</p> 

<p>Poco fue menester para que Tomás tuviese el envite, haciendo consigo en un instante un 
breve discurso de que sería bueno ver a Italia y Flandes y otras diversas tierras y países, 
pues las luengas peregrinaciones hacen a los hombres discretos; y que en esto, a lo más 
largo, podía gastar tres o cuatro años, que, añadidos a los pocos que él tenía, no serían 
tantos que impidiesen volver a sus estudios. Y, como si todo hubiera de suceder a la medida 
de su gusto, dijo al capitán que era contento de irse con él a Italia; pero había de ser 
condición que no se había de sentar debajo de bandera, ni poner en lista de soldado, por no 
obligarse a seguir su bandera; y, aunque el capitán le dijo que no importaba ponerse en 
lista, que ansí gozaría de los socorros y pagas que a la compañía se diesen, porque él le 
daría licencia todas las veces que se la pidiese.</p> 

<p>-Eso sería -dijo Tomás- ir contra mi conciencia y contra la del señor capitán; y así, más 
quiero ir suelto que obligado.</p> 

<p>-Conciencia tan escrupulosa -dijo don Diego-, más es de religioso que de soldado; pero, 
comoquiera que sea, ya somos camaradas.</p> 

<p>Llegaron aquella noche a Antequera, y en pocos días y grandes jornadas se pusieron donde 
estaba la compañía, ya acabada de hacer, y que comenzaba a marchar la vuelta de 
Cartagena, alojándose ella y otras cuatro por los lugares que le venían a mano. Allí notó 
Tomás la autoridad de los comisarios, la incomodidad de algunos capitanes, la solicitud de 
los aposentadores, la industria y cuenta de los pagadores, las quejas de los pueblos, el 
rescatar de las boletas, las insolencias de los bisoños, las pendencias de los huéspedes, el 
pedir bagajes más de los necesarios, y, finalmente, la necesidad casi precisa de hacer todo 
aquello que notaba y mal le parecía.</p> 

<p>Habíase vestido Tomás de papagayo, renunciando los hábitos de estudiante, y púsose a lo 
de Dios es Cristo, como se suele decir. Los muchos libros que tenía los redujo a unas Horas 
de Nuestra Señora y un Garcilaso sin comento, que en las dos faldriqueras llevaba. 
Llegaron más presto de lo que quisieran a Cartagena, porque la vida de los alojamientos es 
ancha y varia, y cada día se topan cosas nuevas y gustosas.</p> 

<p>Allí se embarcaron en cuatro galeras de Nápoles, y allí notó también Tomás Rodaja la 
estraña vida de aquellas marítimas casas, adonde lo más del tiempo maltratan las chinches, 
roban los forzados, enfadan los marineros, destruyen los ratones y fatigan las maretas. 
Pusiéronle temor las grandes borrascas y tormentas, especialmente en el golfo de León, que 
tuvieron dos; que la una los echó en Córcega y la otra los volvió a Tolón, en Francia. En 
fin, trasnochados, mojados y con ojeras, llegaron a la hermosa y bellísima ciudad de 
Génova; y, desembarcándose en su recogido mandrache, después de haber visitado una 
iglesia, dio el capitán con todas sus camaradas en una hostería, donde pusieron en olvido 
todas las borrascas pasadas con el presente gaudeamus.</p> 

<p>Allí conocieron la suavidad del Treviano, el valor del Montefrascón, la fuerza del Asperino, 
la generosidad de los dos griegos Candia y Soma, la grandeza del de las Cinco Viñas, la 
dulzura y apacibilidad de la señora Guarnacha, la rusticidad de la Chéntola, sin que entre 
todos estos señores osase parecer la bajeza del Romanesco. Y, habiendo hecho el huésped 
la reseña de tantos y tan diferentes vinos, se ofreció de hacer parecer allí, sin usar de 
tropelía, ni como pintados en mapa, sino real y verdaderamente, a Madrigal, Coca, Alaejos, 
y a la imperial más que Real Ciudad, recámara del dios de la risa; ofreció a Esquivias, a 
Alanís, a Cazalla, Guadalcanal y la Membrilla, sin que se le olvidase de Ribadavia y de 
Descargamaría. Finalmente, más vinos nombró el huésped, y más les dio, que pudo tener en 
sus bodegas el mismo Baco.</p> 

<p>Admiráronle también al buen Tomás los rubios cabellos de las ginovesas, y la gentileza y 
gallarda disposición de los hombres; la admirable belleza de la ciudad, que en aquellas 
peñas parece que tiene las casas engastadas como diamantes en oro. Otro día se 
desembarcaron todas las compañías que habían de ir al Piamonte; pero no quiso Tomás 
hacer este viaje, sino irse desde allí por tierra a Roma y a Nápoles, como lo hizo, quedando 
de volver por la gran Venecia y por Loreto a Milán y al Piamonte, donde dijo don Diego de 
Valdivia que le hallaría si ya no los hubiesen llevado a Flandes, según se decía. 
Despidióse Tomás del capitán de allí a dos días, y en cinco llegó a Florencia, habiendo 
visto primero a Luca, ciudad pequeña, pero muy bien hecha, y en la que, mejor que en otras 
partes de Italia, son bien vistos y agasajados los españoles. Contentóle Florencia en 
estremo, así por su agradable asiento como por su limpieza, sumptuosos edificios, fresco río 
y apacibles calles. Estuvo en ella cuatro días, y luego se partió a Roma, reina de las 
ciudades y señora del mundo. Visitó sus templos, adoró sus reliquias y admiró su grandeza; 
y, así como por las uñas del león se viene en conocimiento de su grandeza y ferocidad, así 
él sacó la de Roma por sus despedazados mármoles, medias y enteras estatuas, por sus rotos 
arcos y derribadas termas, por sus magníficos pórticos y anfiteatros grandes; por su famoso 
y santo río, que siempre llena sus márgenes de agua y las beatifica con las infinitas reliquias 
de cuerpos de mártires que en ellas tuvieron sepultura; por sus puentes, que parece que se 
están mirando unas a otras, que con sólo el nombre cobran autoridad sobre todas las de las 
otras ciudades del mundo: la vía Apia, la Flaminia, la Julia, con otras deste jaez. Pues no le 
admiraba menos la división de sus montes dentro de sí misma: el Celio, el Quirinal y el 
Vaticano, con los otros cuatro, cuyos nombres manifiestan la grandeza y majestad romana. 
Notó también la autoridad del Colegio de los Cardenales, la majestad del Sumo Pontífice, el 
concurso y variedad de gentes y naciones. Todo lo miró, y notó y puso en su punto. Y, 
habiendo andado la estación de las siete iglesias, y confesádose con un penitenciario, y 
besado el pie a Su Santidad, lleno de agnusdeis y cuentas, determinó irse a Nápoles; y, por 
ser tiempo de mutación, malo y dañoso para todos los que en él entran o salen de Roma, 
como hayan caminado por tierra, se fue por mar a Nápoles, donde a la admiración que traía 
de haber visto a Roma añadió la que le causó ver a Nápoles, ciudad, a su parecer y al de 
todos cuantos la han visto, la mejor de Europa y aun de todo el mundo.</p> 

<p>Desde allí se fue a Sicilia, y vio a Palermo, y después a Micina; de Palermo le pareció bien 
el asiento y belleza, y de Micina, el puerto, y de toda la isla, la abundancia, por quien 
propiamente y con verdad es llamada granero de Italia. Volvióse a Nápoles y a Roma, y de 
allí fue a Nuestra Señora de Loreto, en cuyo santo templo no vio paredes ni murallas, 
porque todas estaban cubiertas de muletas, de mortajas, de cadenas, de grillos, de esposas, 
de cabelleras, de medios bultos de cera y de pinturas y retablos, que daban manifiesto 
indicio de las inumerables mercedes que muchos habían recebido de la mano de Dios, por 
intercesión de su divina Madre, que aquella sacrosanta imagen suya quiso engrandecer y 
autorizar con muchedumbre de milagros, en recompensa de la devoción que le tienen 
aquellos que con semejantes doseles tienen adornados los muros de su casa. Vio el mismo 
aposento y estancia donde se relató la más alta embajada y de más importancia que vieron y 
no entendieron todos los cielos, y todos los ángeles y todos los moradores de las moradas 
sempiternas.</p> 

<p>Desde allí, embarcándose en Ancona, fue a Venecia, ciudad que, a no haber nacido Colón 
en el mundo, no tuviera en él semejante: merced al cielo y al gran Hernando Cortés, que 
conquistó la gran Méjico, para que la gran Venecia tuviese en alguna manera quien se le 
opusiese. Estas dos famosas ciudades se parecen en las calles, que son todas de agua: la de 
Europa, admiración del mundo antiguo; la de América, espanto del mundo nuevo. Parecióle 
que su riqueza era infinita, su gobierno prudente, su sitio inexpugnable, su abundancia 
mucha, sus contornos alegres, y, finalmente, toda ella en sí y en sus partes digna de la fama 
que de su valor por todas las partes del orbe se estiende, dando causa de acreditar más esta 
verdad la máquina de su famoso Arsenal, que es el lugar donde se fabrican las galeras, con 
otros bajeles que no tienen número.</p> 

<p>Por poco fueran los de Calipso los regalos y pasatiempos que halló nuestro curioso en 
Venecia, pues casi le hacían olvidar de su primer intento. Pero, habiendo estado un mes en 
ella, por Ferrara, Parma y Plasencia volvió a Milán, oficina de Vulcano, ojeriza del reino de 
Francia; ciudad, en fin, de quien se dice que puede decir y hacer, haciéndola magnífica la 
grandeza suya y de su templo y su maravillosa abundancia de todas las cosas a la vida 
humana necesarias. Desde allí se fue a Aste, y llegó a tiempo que otro día marchaba el 
tercio a Flandes.</p> 

<p>Fue muy bien recebido de su amigo el capitán, y en su compañía y camarada pasó a 
Flandes, y llegó a Amberes, ciudad no menos para maravillar que las que había visto en 
Italia. Vio a Gante, y a Bruselas, y vio que todo el país se disponía a tomar las armas, para 
salir en campaña el verano siguiente.</p> 

<p>Y, habiendo cumplido con el deseo que le movió a ver lo que había visto, determinó 
volverse a España y a Salamanca a acabar sus estudios; y como lo pensó lo puso luego por 
obra, con pesar grandísimo de su camarada, que le rogó, al tiempo del despedirse, le avisase 
de su salud, llegada y suceso. Prometióselo ansí como lo pedía, y, por Francia, volvió a 
España, sin haber visto a París, por estar puesta en armas. En fin, llegó a Salamanca, donde 
fue bien recebido de sus amigos, y, con la comodidad que ellos le hicieron, prosiguió sus 
estudios hasta graduarse de licenciado en leyes.</p> 

<p>Sucedió que en este tiempo llegó a aquella ciudad una dama de todo rumbo y manejo. 
Acudieron luego a la añagaza y reclamo todos los pájaros del lugar, sin quedar vademécum 
que no la visitase. Dijéronle a Tomás que aquella dama decía que había estado en Italia y en 
Flandes, y, por ver si la conocía, fue a visitarla, de cuya visita y vista quedó ella enamorada 
de Tomás. Y él, sin echar de ver en ello, si no era por fuerza y llevado de otros, no quería 
entrar en su casa. Finalmente, ella le descubrió su voluntad y le ofreció su hacienda. Pero, 
como él atendía más a sus libros que a otros pasatiempos, en ninguna manera respondía al 
gusto de la señora; la cual, viéndose desdeñada y, a su parecer, aborrecida y que por medios 
ordinarios y comunes no podía conquistar la roca de la voluntad de Tomás, acordó de 
buscar otros modos, a su parecer más eficaces y bastantes para salir con el cumplimiento de 
sus deseos. Y así, aconsejada de una morisca, en un membrillo toledano dio a Tomás unos 
destos que llaman hechizos, creyendo que le daba cosa que le forzase la voluntad a 
quererla: como si hubiese en el mundo yerbas, encantos ni palabras suficientes a forzar el 
libre albedrío; y así, las que dan estas bebidas o comidas amatorias se llaman veneficios; 
porque no es otra cosa lo que hacen sino dar veneno a quien las toma, como lo tiene 
mostrado la experiencia en muchas y diversas ocasiones.</p> 

<p>Comió en tan mal punto Tomás el membrillo, que al momento comenzó a herir de pie y de 
mano como si tuviera alferecía, y sin volver en sí estuvo muchas horas, al cabo de las 
cuales volvió como atontado, y dijo con lengua turbada y tartamuda que un membrillo que 
había comido le había muerto, y declaró quién se le había dado. La justicia, que tuvo 
noticia del caso, fue a buscar la malhechora; pero ya ella, viendo el mal suceso, se había 
puesto en cobro y no pareció jamás.</p> 

<p>Seis meses estuvo en la cama Tomás, en los cuales se secó y se puso, como suele decirse, 
en los huesos, y mostraba tener turbados todos los sentidos. Y, aunque le hicieron los 
remedios posibles, sólo le sanaron la enfermedad del cuerpo, pero no de lo del 
entendimiento, porque quedó sano, y loco de la más estraña locura que entre las locuras 
hasta entonces se había visto. Imaginóse el desdichado que era todo hecho de vidrio, y con 
esta imaginación, cuando alguno se llegaba a él, daba terribles voces pidiendo y suplicando 
con palabras y razones concertadas que no se le acercasen, porque le quebrarían; que real y 
verdaderamente él no era como los otros hombres: que todo era de vidrio de pies a cabeza.</p> 

<p>Para sacarle desta estraña imaginación, muchos, sin atender a sus voces y rogativas, 
arremetieron a él y le abrazaron, diciéndole que advirtiese y mirase cómo no se quebraba. 
Pero lo que se granjeaba en esto era que el pobre se echaba en el suelo dando mil gritos, y 
luego le tomaba un desmayo del cual no volvía en sí en cuatro horas; y cuando volvía, era 
renovando las plegarias y rogativas de que otra vez no le llegasen. Decía que le hablasen 
desde lejos y le preguntasen lo que quisiesen, porque a todo les respondería con más 
entendimiento, por ser hombre de vidrio y no de carne: que el vidrio, por ser de materia 
sutil y delicada, obraba por ella el alma con más promptitud y eficacia que no por la del 
cuerpo, pesada y terrestre.</p> 

<p>Quisieron algunos experimentar si era verdad lo que decía; y así, le preguntaron muchas y 
difíciles cosas, a las cuales respondió espontáneamente con grandísima agudeza de ingenio: 
cosa que causó admiración a los más letrados de la Universidad y a los profesores de la 
medicina y filosofía, viendo que en un sujeto donde se contenía tan extraordinaria locura 
como era el pensar que fuese de vidrio, se encerrase tan grande entendimiento que 
respondiese a toda pregunta con propiedad y agudeza.</p> 

<p>Pidió Tomás le diesen alguna funda donde pusiese aquel vaso quebradizo de su cuerpo, 
porque al vestirse algún vestido estrecho no se quebrase; y así, le dieron una ropa parda y 
una camisa muy ancha, que él se vistió con mucho tiento y se ciñó con una cuerda de 
algodón. No quiso calzarse zapatos en ninguna manera, y el orden que tuvo para que le 
diesen de comer, sin que a él llegasen, fue poner en la punta de una vara una vasera de 
orinal, en la cual le ponían alguna cosa de fruta de las que la sazón del tiempo ofrecía. 
Carne ni pescado, no lo quería; no bebía sino en fuente o en río, y esto con las manos; 
cuando andaba por las calles iba por la mitad dellas, mirando a los tejados, temeroso no le 
cayese alguna teja encima y le quebrase. Los veranos dormía en el campo al cielo abierto, y 
los inviernos se metía en algún mesón, y en el pajar se enterraba hasta la garganta, diciendo 
que aquélla era la más propia y más segura cama que podían tener los hombres de vidrio. 
Cuando tronaba, temblaba como un azogado, y se salía al campo y no entraba en poblado 
hasta haber pasado la tempestad.</p> 

<p>Tuviéronle encerrado sus amigos mucho tiempo; pero, viendo que su desgracia pasaba 
adelante, determinaron de condecender con lo que él les pedía, que era le dejasen andar 
libre; y así, le dejaron, y él salió por la ciudad, causando admiración y lástima a todos los 
que le conocían.</p> 

<p>Cercáronle luego los muchachos; pero él con la vara los detenía, y les rogaba le hablasen 
apartados, porque no se quebrase; que, por ser hombre de vidrio, era muy tierno y 
quebradizo. Los muchachos, que son la más traviesa generación del mundo, a despecho de 
sus ruegos y voces, le comenzaron a tirar trapos, y aun piedras, por ver si era de vidrio, 
como él decía. Pero él daba tantas voces y hacía tales estremos, que movía a los hombres a 
que riñesen y castigasen a los muchachos porque no le tirasen.</p> 

<p>Mas un día que le fatigaron mucho se volvió a ellos, diciendo:</p> 

<p>-¿Qué me queréis, muchachos, porfiados como moscas, sucios como chinches, atrevidos 
como pulgas? ¿Soy yo, por ventura, el monte Testacho de Roma, para que me tiréis tantos 
tiestos y tejas?</p> 

<p>Por oírle reñir y responder a todos, le seguían siempre muchos, y los muchachos tomaron y 
tuvieron por mejor partido antes oílle que tiralle.</p>
 
<p>Pasando, pues, una vez por la ropería de Salamanca, le dijo una ropera:</p> 

<p>-En mi ánima, señor Licenciado, que me pesa de su desgracia; pero, ¿qué haré, que no 
puedo llorar?</p> 

<p>Él se volvió a ella, y muy mesurado le dijo:</p> 

<p>-Filiae Hierusalem, plorate super vos et super filios vestros.</p> 

<p>Entendió el marido de la ropera la malicia del dicho y díjole:</p> 

<p>-Hermano licenciado Vidriera (que así decía él que se llamaba), más tenéis de bellaco que 
de loco.</p> 

<p>-No se me da un ardite -respondió él-, como no tenga nada de necio.</p>
 
<p>Pasando un día por la casa llana y venta común, vio que estaban a la puerta della muchas de 
sus moradoras, y dijo que eran bagajes del ejército de Satanás que estaban alojados en el 
mesón del infierno.</p> 

<p>Preguntóle uno que qué consejo o consuelo daría a un amigo suyo que estaba muy triste 
porque su mujer se le había ido con otro.</p> 

<p>A lo cual respondió:</p> 

<p>-Dile que dé gracias a Dios por haber permitido le llevasen de casa a su enemigo.</p> 

<p>-Luego, ¿no irá a buscarla? -dijo el otro.</p> 

<p>-¡Ni por pienso! -replicó Vidriera-; porque sería el hallarla hallar un perpetuo y verdadero 
testigo de su deshonra.</p> 

<p>-Ya que eso sea así -dijo el mismo-, ¿qué haré yo para tener paz con mi mujer?</p> 

<p>Respondióle:</p> 

<p>-Dale lo que hubiere menester; déjala que mande a todos los de su casa, pero no sufras que 
ella te mande a ti.</p> 

<p>Díjole un muchacho:</p> 

<p>-Señor licenciado Vidriera, yo me quiero desgarrar de mi padre porque me azota muchas 
veces.</p> 

<p>Y respondióle:</p> 

<p>-Advierte, niño, que los azotes que los padres dan a los hijos honran, y los del verdugo 
afrentan.</p> 

<p>Estando a la puerta de una iglesia, vio que entraba en ella un labrador de los que siempre 
blasonan de cristianos viejos, y detrás dél venía uno que no estaba en tan buena opinión 
como el primero; y el Licenciado dio grandes voces al labrador, diciendo:</p> 

<p>-Esperad, Domingo, a que pase el Sábado.</p> 

<p>De los maestros de escuela decía que eran dichosos, pues trataban siempre con ángeles; y 
que fueran dichosísimos si los angelitos no fueran mocosos.</p> 

<p>Otro le preguntó que qué le parecía de las alcahuetas. Respondió que no lo eran las 
apartadas, sino las vecinas.</p> 

<p>Las nuevas de su locura y de sus respuestas y dichos se estendió por toda Castilla; y, 
llegando a noticia de un príncipe, o señor, que estaba en la Corte, quiso enviar por él, y 
encargóselo a un caballero amigo suyo, que estaba en Salamanca, que se lo enviase; y, 
topándole el caballero un día, le dijo:</p> 

<p>-Sepa el señor licenciado Vidriera que un gran personaje de la Corte le quiere ver y envía 
por él.</p> 

<p>A lo cual respondió:</p> 

<p>-Vuesa merced me escuse con ese señor, que yo no soy bueno para palacio, porque tengo 
vergüenza y no sé lisonjear.</p> 

<p>Con todo esto, el caballero le envió a la Corte, y para traerle usaron con él desta invención: 
pusiéronle en unas árg[u]enas de paja, como aquéllas donde llevan el vidrio, igualando los 
tercios con piedras, y entre paja puestos algunos vidrios, porque se diese a entender que 
como vaso de vidrio le llevaban. Llegó a Valladolid; entró de noche y desembanastáronle 
en la casa del señor que había enviado por él, de quien fue muy bien recebido, diciéndole:</p> 

<p>-Sea muy bien venido el señor licenciado Vidriera. ¿Cómo ha ido en el camino? ¿Cómo va 
de salud?</p> 

<p>A lo cual respondió:</p> 

<p>-Ningún camino hay malo, como se acabe, si no es el que va a la horca. De salud estoy 
neutral, porque están encontrados mis pulsos con mi celebro.</p> 

<p>Otro día, habiendo visto en muchas alcándaras muchos neblíes y azores y otros pájaros de 
volatería, dijo que la caza de altanería era digna de príncipes y de grandes señores; pero que 
advirtiesen que con ella echaba el gusto censo sobre el provecho a más de dos mil por uno. 
La caza de liebres dijo que era muy gustosa, y más cuando se cazaba con galgos prestados.</p> 

<p>El caballero gustó de su locura y dejóle salir por la ciudad, debajo del amparo y guarda de 
un hombre que tuviese cuenta que los muchachos no le hiciesen mal; de los cuales y de 
toda la Corte fue conocido en seis días, y a cada paso, en cada calle y en cualquiera 
esquina, respondía a todas las preguntas que le hacían; entre las cuales le preguntó un 
estudiante si era poeta, porque le parecía que tenía ingenio para todo.</p> 

<p>A lo cual respondió:</p> 

<p>-Hasta ahora no he sido tan necio ni tan venturoso.</p> 

<p>-No entiendo eso de necio y venturoso -dijo el estudiante.</p> 

<p>Y respondió Vidriera:</p> 

<p>-No he sido tan necio que diese en poeta malo, ni tan venturoso que haya merecido serlo 
bueno.</p> 

<p>Preguntóle otro estudiante que en qué estimación tenía a los poetas. Respondió que a la 
ciencia, en mucha; pero que a los poetas, en ninguna. Replicáronle que por qué decía 
aquello. Respondió que del infinito número de poetas que había, eran tan pocos los buenos, 
que casi no hacían número; y así, como si no hubiese poetas, no los estimaba; pero que 
admiraba y reverenciaba la ciencia de la poesía porque encerraba en sí todas las demás 
ciencias: porque de todas se sirve, de todas se adorna, y pule y saca a luz sus maravillosas 
obras, con que llena el mundo de provecho, de deleite y de maravilla.</p> 

<p>Añadió más:</p> 

<p>-Yo bien sé en lo que se debe estimar un buen poeta, porque se me acuerda de aquellos 
versos de Ovidio que dicen:</p> 

<blockquote>Cum ducum fuerant olim Regnumque poeta:<br> 
premiaque antiqui magna tulere chori.<br> 
Sanctaque maiestas, et erat venerabile nomen<br> 
vatibus; et large sape dabantur opes.</blockquote> 

<p>&raquo;Y menos se me olvida la alta calidad de los poetas, pues los llama Platón intérpretes de los 
dioses, y dellos dice Ovidio:</p>

<blockquote>Est Deus in nobis, agitante calescimus illo.</blockquote> 

<p>&raquo;Y también dice:</p> 

<blockquote>At sacri vates, et Divum cura vocamus.</blockquote> 

<p>&raquo;Esto se dice de los buenos poetas; que de los malos, de los churrulleros, ¿qué se ha de 
decir, sino que son la idiotez y la arrogancia del mundo?</p>

<p>Y añadió más:</p> 

<p>-¡Qué es ver a un poeta destos de la primera impresión cuando quiere decir un soneto a 
otros que le rodean, las salvas que les hace diciendo: ''Vuesas mercedes escuchen un 
sonetillo que anoche a cierta ocasión hice, que, a mi parecer, aunque no vale nada, tiene un 
no sé qué de bonito!'' Y en esto tuerce los labios, pone en arco las cejas y se rasca la 
faldriquera, y de entre otros mil papeles mugrientos y medio rotos, donde queda otro millar 
de sonetos, saca el que quiere relatar, y al fin le dice con tono melifluo y alfenicado. Y si 
acaso los que le escuchan, de socarrones o de ignorantes, no se le alaban, dice: ''O vuesas 
mercedes no han entendido el soneto, o yo no le he sabido decir; y así, será bien recitarle 
otra vez y que vuesas mercedes le presten más atención, porque en verdad en verdad que el 
soneto lo merece''. Y vuelve como primero a recitarle con nuevos ademanes y nuevas 
pausas. Pues, ¿qué es verlos censurar los unos a los otros? ¿Qué diré del ladrar que hacen 
los cachorros y modernos a los mastinazos antiguos y graves? ¿Y qué de los que murmuran 
de algunos ilustres y excelentes sujetos, donde resplandece la verdadera luz de la poesía; 
que, tomándola por alivio y entretenimiento de sus muchas y graves ocupaciones, muestran 
la divinidad de sus ingenios y la alteza de sus conceptos, a despecho y pesar del 
circunspecto ignorante que juzga de lo que no sabe y aborrece lo que no entiende, y del que 
quiere que se estime y tenga en precio la necedad que se sienta debajo de doseles y la 
ignorancia que se arrima a los sitiales?</p> 

<p>Otra vez le preguntaron qué era la causa de que los poetas, por la mayor parte, eran pobres. 
Respondió que porque ellos querían, pues estaba en su mano ser ricos, si se sabían 
aprovechar de la ocasión que por momentos traían entre las manos, que eran las de sus 
damas, que todas eran riquísimas en estremo, pues tenían los cabellos de oro, la frente de 
plata bruñida, los ojos de verdes esmeraldas, los dientes de marfil, los labios de coral y la 
garganta de cristal transparente, y que lo que lloraban eran líquidas perlas; y más, que lo 
que sus plantas pisaban, por dura y estéril tierra que fuese, al momento producía jazmines y 
rosas; y que su aliento era de puro ámbar, almizcle y algalia; y que todas estas cosas eran 
señales y muestras de su mucha riqueza. Estas y otras cosas decía de los malos poetas, que 
de los buenos siempre dijo bien y los levantó sobre el cuerno de la luna.</p> 

<p>Vio un día en la acera de San Francisco unas figuras pintadas de mala mano, y dijo que los 
buenos pintores imitaban a naturaleza, pero que los malos la vomitaban.</p> 

<p>Arrimóse un día con grandísimo tiento, porque no se quebrase, a la tienda de un librero, y 
díjole:</p> 

<p>-Este oficio me contentara mucho si no fuera por una falta que tiene.</p> 

<p>Preguntóle el librero se la dijese. Respondióle:</p> 

<p>-Los melindres que hacen cuando compran un privilegio de un libro, y de la burla que 
hacen a su autor si acaso le imprime a su costa; pues, en lugar de mil y quinientos, 
imprimen tres mil libros, y, cuando el autor piensa que se venden los suyos, se despachan 
los ajenos.</p> 

<p>Acaeció este mismo día que pasaron por la plaza seis azotados; y, diciendo el pregón: "Al 
primero, por ladrón", dio grandes voces a los que estaban delante dél, diciéndoles:</p> 

<p>-¡Apartaos, hermanos, no comience aquella cuenta por alguno de vosotros!</p> 

<p>Y cuando el pregonero llegó a decir: "Al trasero...", dijo:</p>
 
<p>-Aquel debe de ser el fiador de los muchachos.</p> 

<p>Un muchacho le dijo:</p> 

<p>-Hermano Vidriera, mañana sacan a azotar a una alcagüeta.</p> 

<p>Respondióle:</p> 

<p>-Si dijeras que sacaban a azotar a un alcagüete, entendiera que sacaban a azotar un coche.</p> 

<p>Hallóse allí uno destos que llevan sillas de manos, y díjole:</p> 

<p>-De nosotros, Licenciado, ¿no tenéis qué decir?</p>
 
<p>-No -respondió Vidriera-, sino que sabe cada uno de vosotros más pecados que un confesor; 
más es con esta diferencia: que el confesor los sabe para tenerlos secretos, y vosotros para 
publicarlos por las tabernas.</p> 

<p>Oyó esto un mozo de mulas, porque de todo género de gente le estaba escuchando contino, 
y díjole:</p> 

<p>-De nosotros, señor Redoma, poco o nada hay que decir, porque somos gente de bien y 
necesaria en la república.</p> 

<p>A lo cual respondió Vidriera:</p> 

<p>-La honra del amo descubre la del criado. Según esto, mira a quién sirves y verás cuán 
honrado eres: mozos sois vosotros de la más ruin canalla que sustenta la tierra. Una vez, 
cuando no era de vidrio, caminé una jornada en una mula de alquiler tal, que le conté ciento 
y veinte y una tachas, todas capitales y enemigas del género humano. Todos los mozos de 
mulas tienen su punta de rufianes, su punta de cacos, y su es no es de truhanes. Si sus amos 
(que así llaman ellos a los que llevan en sus mulas) son boquimuelles, hacen más suertes en 
ellos que las que echaron en esta ciudad los años pasados: si son estranjeros, los roban; si 
estudiantes, los maldicen; y si religiosos, los reniegan; y si soldados, los tiemblan. Estos, y 
los marineros y carreteros y arrieros, tienen un modo de vivir extraordinario y sólo para 
ellos: el carretero pasa lo más de la vida en espacio de vara y media de lugar, que poco más 
debe de haber del yugo de las mulas a la boca del carro; canta la mitad del tiempo y la otra 
mitad reniega; y en decir: "Háganse a zaga" se les pasa otra parte; y si acaso les queda por 
sacar alguna rueda de algún atolladero, más se ayudan de dos pésetes que de tres mulas. 
Los marineros son gente gentil, inurbana, que no sabe otro lenguaje que el que se usa en los 
navíos; en la bonanza son diligentes y en la borrasca perezosos; en la tormenta mandan 
muchos y obedecen pocos; su Dios es su arca y su rancho, y su pasatiempo ver mareados a 
los pasajeros. Los arrieros son gente que ha hecho divorcio con las sábanas y se ha casado 
con las enjalmas; son tan diligentes y presurosos que, a trueco de no perder la jornada, 
perderán el alma; su música es la del mortero; su salsa, la hambre; sus maitines, levantarse 
a dar sus piensos; y sus misas, no oír ninguna.</p> 

<p>Cuando esto decía, estaba a la puerta de un boticario, y, volviéndose al dueño, le dijo:</p> 

<p>-Vuesa merced tiene un saludable oficio, si no fuese tan enemigo de sus candiles.</p> 

<p>-¿En qué modo soy enemigo de mis candiles? -preguntó el boticario.</p> 

<p>Y respondió Vidriera:</p> 

<p>-Esto digo porque, en faltando cualquiera aceite, la suple la del candil que está más a mano; 
y aún tiene otra cosa este oficio bastante a quitar el crédito al más acertado médico del 
mundo.</p> 

<p>Preguntándole por qué, respondió que había boticario que, por no decir que faltaba en su 
botica lo que recetaba el médico, por las cosas que le faltaban ponía otras que a su parecer 
tenían la misma virtud y calidad, no siendo así; y con esto, la medicina mal compuesta 
obraba al revés de lo que había de obrar la bien ordenada.</p>
 
<p>Preguntóle entonces uno que qué sentía de los médicos, y respondió esto:</p> 

<p>-Honora medicum propter necessitatem, etenim creavit eum Altissimus. A Deo enim est 
omnis medela, et a rege accipiet donationem. Disciplina medici exaltavit caput illius, et in 
conspectu magnatum collaudabitur. Altissimus de terra creavit medicinam, et vir prudens 
non ab[h]orre-bit illam. Esto dice -dijo- el Eclesiástico de la medicina y de los buenos 
médicos, y de los malos se podría decir todo al revés, porque no hay gente más dañosa a la 
república que ellos. El juez nos puede torcer o dilatar la justicia; el letrado, sustentar por su 
interés nuestra injusta demanda; el mercader, chuparnos la hacienda; finalmente, todas las 
personas con quien de necesidad tratamos nos pueden hacer algún daño; pero quitarnos la 
vida, sin quedar sujetos al temor del castigo, ninguno. Sólo los médicos nos pueden matar y 
nos matan sin temor y a pie quedo, sin desenvainar otra espada que la de un récipe. Y no 
hay descubrirse sus delictos, porque al momento los meten debajo de la tierra. 
Acuérdaseme que cuando yo era hombre de carne, y no de vidrio como agora soy, que a un 
médico destos de segunda clase le despidió un enfermo por curarse con otro, y el primero, 
de allí a cuatro días, acertó a pasar por la botica donde receptaba el segundo, y preguntó al 
boticario que cómo le iba al enfermo que él había dejado, y que si le había receptado alguna 
purga el otro médico. El boticario le respondió que allí tenía una recepta de purga que el día 
siguiente había de tomar el enfermo. Dijo que se la mostrase, y vio que al fin della estaba 
escrito: Sumat dilúculo; y dijo: ''Todo lo que lleva esta purga me contenta, si no es este 
dilúculo, porque es húmido demasiadamente''.</p> 

<p>Por estas y otras cosas que decía de todos los oficios, se andaban tras él, sin hacerle mal y 
sin dejarle sosegar; pero, con todo esto, no se pudiera defender de los muchachos si su 
guardián no le defendiera. Preguntóle uno qué haría para no tener envidia a nadie. 
Respondióle:</p> 

<p>-Duerme; que todo el tiempo que durmieres serás igual al que envidias.</p> 

<p>Otro le preguntó qué remedio tendría para salir con una comisión que había dos años que la 
pretendía. Y díjole:</p> 

<p>-Parte a caballo y a la mira de quien la lleva, y acompáñale hasta salir de la ciudad, y así 
saldrás con ella.</p> 

<p>Pasó acaso una vez por delante donde él estaba un juez de comisión que iba de camino a 
una causa criminal, y llevaba mucha gente consigo y dos alguaciles; preguntó quién era, y, 
como se lo dijeron, dijo:</p> 

<p>-Yo apostaré que lleva aquel juez víboras en el seno, pistoletes en la cinta y rayos en las 
manos, para destruir todo lo que alcanzare su comisión. Yo me acuerdo haber tenido un 
amigo que, en una comisión criminal que tuvo, dio una sentencia tan exorbitante, que 
excedía en muchos quilates a la culpa de los delincuentes. Preguntéle que por qué había 
dado aquella tan cruel sentencia y hecho tan manifiesta injusticia. Respondióme que 
pensaba otorgar la apelación, y que con esto dejaba campo abierto a los señores del Consejo 
para mostrar su misericordia, moderando y poniendo aquella su rigurosa sentencia en su 
punto y debida proporción. Yo le respondí que mejor fuera haberla dado de manera que les 
quitara de aquel trabajo, pues con esto le tuvieran a él por juez recto y acertado. 
En la rueda de la mucha gente que, como se ha dicho, siempre le estaba oyendo, estaba un 
conocido suyo en hábito de letrado, al cual otro le llamó Señor Licenciado; y, sabiendo 
Vidriera que el tal a quien llamaron licenciado no tenía ni aun título de bachiller, le dijo:</p> 

<p>-Guardaos, compadre, no encuentren con vuestro título los frailes de la redempción de 
cautivos, que os le llevarán por mostrenco.</p> 

<p>A lo cual dijo el amigo:</p> 

<p>-Tratémonos bien, señor Vidriera, pues ya sabéis vos que soy hombre de altas y de 
profundas letras.</p> 

<p>Respondióle Vidriera:</p> 

<p>-Ya yo sé que sois un Tántalo en ellas, porque se os van por altas y no las alcanzáis de 
profundas.</p> 

<p>Estando una vez arrimado a la tienda de un sastre, viole que estaba mano sobre mano, y 
díjole:</p> 

<p>-Sin duda, señor maeso, que estáis en camino de salvación.</p>
 
<p>-¿En qué lo veis? -preguntó el sastre.</p> 

<p>-¿En qué lo veo? -respondió Vidriera-. Véolo en que, pues no tenéis qué hacer, no tendréis 
ocasión de mentir.</p> 

<p>Y añadió:</p> 

<p>-Desdichado del sastre que no miente y cose las fiestas; cosa maravillosa es que casi en 
todos los deste oficio apenas se hallará uno que haga un vestido justo, habiendo tantos que 
los hagan pecadores.</p> 

<p>De los zapateros decía que jamás hacían, conforme a su parecer, zapato malo; porque si al 
que se le calzaban venía estrecho y apretado, le decían que así había de ser, por ser de 
galanes calzar justo, y que en trayéndolos dos horas vendrían más anchos que alpargates; y 
si le venían anchos, decían que así habían de venir, por amor de la gota.</p>

<p>Un muchacho agudo que escribía en un oficio de Provincia le apretaba mucho con 
preguntas y demandas, y le traía nuevas de lo que en la ciudad pasaba, porque sobre todo 
discantaba y a todo respondía. Éste le dijo una vez:</p>
 
<p>-Vidriera, esta noche se murió en la cárcel un banco que estaba condenado ahorcar.</p> 

<p>A lo cual respondió:</p> 

<p>-Él hizo bien a darse priesa a morir antes que el verdugo se sentara sobre él.</p> 

<p>En la acera de San Francisco estaba un corro de ginoveses; y, pasando por allí, uno dellos le 
llamó, diciéndole:</p> 

<p>-Lléguese acá el señor Vidriera y cuéntenos un cuento.</p> 

<p>Él respondió:</p> 

<p>-No quiero, porque no me le paséis a Génova.</p> 

<p>Topó una vez a una tendera que llevaba delante de sí una hija suya muy fea, pero muy llena 
de dijes, de galas y de perlas; y díjole a la madre:</p> 

<p>-Muy bien habéis hecho en empedralla, porque se pueda pasear.</p> 

<p>De los pasteleros dijo que había muchos años que jugaban a la dobladilla, sin que les 
llevasen [a] la pena, porque habían hecho el pastel de a dos de a cuatro, el de a cuatro de a 
ocho, y el de a ocho de a medio real, por sólo su albedrío y beneplácito.</p> 

<p>De los titereros decía mil males: decía que era gente vagamunda y que trataba con 
indecencia de las cosas divinas, porque con las figuras que mostraban en sus retratos 
volvían la devoción en risa, y que les acontecía envasar en un costal todas o las más figuras 
del Testamento Viejo y Nuevo y sentarse sobre él a comer y beber en los bodegones y 
tabernas. En resolución, decía que se maravillaba de cómo quien podía no les ponía 
perpetuo silencio en sus retablos, o los desterraba del reino.</p> 

<p>Acertó a pasar una vez por donde él estaba un comediante vestido como un príncipe, y, en 
viéndole, dijo:</p> 

<p>-Yo me acuerdo haber visto a éste salir al teatro enharinado el rostro y vestido un zamarro 
del revés; y, con todo esto, a cada paso fuera del tablado, jura a fe de hijodalgo.</p>
 
<p>-Débelo de ser -respondió uno-, porque hay muchos comediantes que son muy bien nacidos 
y hijosdalgo.</p> 

<p>-Así será verdad -replicó Vidriera-, pero lo que menos ha menester la farsa es personas bien 
nacidas; galanes sí, gentileshombres y de espeditas lenguas. También sé decir dellos que en 
el sudor de su cara ganan su pan con inllevable trabajo, tomando contino de memoria, 
hechos perpetuos gitanos, de lugar en lugar y de mesón en venta, desvelándose en contentar 
a otros, porque en el gusto ajeno consiste su bien propio. Tienen más, que con su oficio no 
engañan a nadie, pues por momentos sacan su mercaduría a pública plaza, al juicio y a la 
vista de todos. El trabajo de los autores es increíble, y su cuidado, extraordinario, y han de 
ganar mucho para que al cabo del año no salgan tan empeñados, que les sea forzoso hacer 
pleito de acreedores. Y, con todo esto, son necesarios en la república, como lo son las 
florestas, las alamedas y las vistas de recreación, y como lo son las cosas que honestamente 
recrean.</p> 

<p>Decía que había sido opinión de un amigo suyo que el que servía a una comedianta, en sola 
una servía a muchas damas juntas, como era a una reina, a una ninfa, a una diosa, a una 
fregona, a una pastora, y muchas veces caía la suerte en que serviese en ella a un paje y a 
un lacayo: que todas estas y más figuras suele hacer una farsanta.</p> 

<p>Preguntóle uno que cuál había sido el más dichoso del mundo. Respondió que Nemo; 
porque Nemo novit Patrem, Nemo sine crimine vivit, Nemo sua sorte contentus, Nemo 
ascendit in coelum.</p> 

<p>De los diestros dijo una vez que eran maestros de una ciencia o arte que cuando la habían 
menester no la sabían, y que tocaban algo en presumptuosos, pues querían reducir a 
demostraciones matemáticas, que son infalibles, los movimientos y pensamientos coléricos 
de sus contrarios. Con los que se teñían las barbas tenía particular enemistad; y, riñendo 
una vez delante dél dos hombres, que el uno era portugués, éste dijo al castellano, asiéndose 
de las barbas, que tenía muy teñidas:</p> 

<p>-¡Por istas barbas que teño no rostro...!</p> 

<p>A lo cual acudió Vidriera:</p> 

<p>-¡Ollay, home, naon digáis teño, sino tiño!</p> 

<p>Otro traía las barbas jaspeadas y de muchas colores, culpa de la mala tinta; a quien dijo 
Vidriera que tenía las barbas de muladar overo. A otro, que traía las barbas por mitad 
blancas y negras, por haberse descuidado, y los cañones crecidos, le dijo que procurase de 
no porfiar ni reñir con nadie, porque estaba aparejado a que le dijesen que mentía por la 
mitad de la barba.</p> 

<p>Una vez contó que una doncella discreta y bien entendida, por acudir a la voluntad de sus 
padres, dio el sí de casarse con un viejo todo cano, el cual la noche antes del día del 
desposorio se fue, no al río Jordán, como dicen las viejas, sino a la redomilla del agua 
fuerte y plata, con que renovó de manera su barba, que la acostó de nieve y la levantó de 
pez. Llegóse la hora de darse las manos, y la doncella conoció por la pinta y por la tinta la 
figura, y dijo a sus padres que le diesen el mismo esposo que ellos le habían mostrado, que 
no quería otro. Ellos le dijeron que aquel que tenía delante era el mismo que le habían 
mostrado y dado por esposo. Ella replicó que no era, y trujo testigos cómo el que sus padres 
le dieron era un hombre grave y lleno de canas; y que, pues el presente no las tenía, no era 
él, y se llamaba a engaño. Atúvose a esto, corrióse el teñido y deshízose el casamiento.</p> 

<p>Con las dueñas tenía la misma ojeriza que con los escabecha-dos: decía maravillas de su 
permafoy, de las mortajas de sus tocas, de sus muchos melindres, de sus escrúpulos y de su 
extraordinaria miseria. Amohinábanle sus flaquezas de estómago, su vaguidos de cabeza, su 
modo de hablar, con más repulgos que sus tocas; y, finalmente, su inutilidad y sus vainillas.</p>
 
<p>Uno le dijo:</p> 

<p>-¿Qué es esto, señor licenciado, que os he oído decir mal de muchos oficios y jamás lo 
habéis dicho de los escribanos, habiendo tanto que decir?</p> 

<p>A lo cual respondió:</p> 

<p>-Aunque de vidrio, no soy tan frágil que me deje ir con la corriente del vulgo, las más veces 
engañado. Paréceme a mí que la gramática de los murmuradores y el la, la, la de los que 
cantan son los escribanos; porque, así como no se puede pasar a otras ciencias, si no es por 
la puerta de la gramática, y como el músico primero murmura que canta, así, los 
maldicientes, por donde comienzan a mostrar la malignidad de sus lenguas es por decir mal 
de los escribanos y alguaciles y de los otros ministros de la justicia, siendo un oficio el del 
escribano sin el cual andaría la verdad por el mundo a sombra de tejados, corrida y 
maltratada; y así, dice el Eclesiástico: In manu Dei potestas hominis est, et super faciem 
scribe imponet honorem. Es el escribano persona pública, y el oficio del juez no se puede 
ejercitar cómodamente sin el suyo. Los escribanos han de ser libres, y no esclavos, ni hijos 
de esclavos: legítimos, no bastardos ni de ninguna mala raza nacidos. Juran de secreto 
fidelidad y que no harán escritura usuraria; que ni amistad ni enemistad, provecho o daño 
les moverá a no hacer su oficio con buena y cristiana conciencia. Pues si este oficio tantas 
buenas partes requiere, ¿por qué se ha de pensar que de más de veinte mil escribanos que 
hay en España se lleve el diablo la cosecha, como si fuesen cepas de su majuelo? No lo 
quiero creer, ni es bien que ninguno lo crea; porque, finalmente, digo que es la gente más 
necesaria que había en las repúblicas bien ordenadas, y que si llevaban demasiados 
derechos, también hacían demasiados tuertos, y que destos dos estremos podía resultar un 
medio que les hiciese mirar por el virote.</p> 

<p>De los alguaciles dijo que no era mucho que tuviesen algunos enemigos, siendo su oficio, o 
prenderte, o sacarte la hacienda de casa, o tenerte en la suya en guarda y comer a tu costa. 
Tachaba la negligencia e ignorancia de los procuradores y solicitadores, comparándolos a 
los médicos, los cuales, que sane o no sane el enfermo, ellos llevan su propina, y los 
procuradores y solicitadores, lo mismo, salgan o no salgan con el pleito que ayudan.</p> 

<p>Preguntóle uno cuál era la mejor tierra. Respondió que la temprana y agradecida. Replicó el 
otro:</p> 

<p>-No pregunto eso, sino que cuál es mejor lugar: ¿Valladolid o Madrid?</p> 

<p>Y respondió:</p> 

<p>-De Madrid, los estremos; de Valladolid, los medios.</p>
 
<p>-No lo entiendo -repitió el que se lo preguntaba.</p>
 
<p>Y dijo:</p> 

<p>-De Madrid, cielo y suelo; de Valladolid, los entresuelos.</p> 

<p>Oyó Vidriera que dijo un hombre a otro que, así como había entrado en Valladolid, había 
caído su mujer muy enferma, porque la había probado la tierra.</p> 

<p>A lo cual dijo Vidriera:</p> 

<p>-Mejor fuera que se la hubiera comido, si acaso es celosa.</p> 

<p>De los músicos y de los correos de a pie decía que tenían las esperanzas y las suertes 
limitadas, porque los unos la acababan con llegar a serlo de a caballo, y los otros con 
alcanzar a ser músicos del rey. De las damas que llaman cortesanas decía que todas, o las 
más, tenían más de corteses que de sanas.</p> 

<p>Estando un día en una iglesia vio que traían a enterrar a un viejo, a bautizar a un niño y a 
velar una mujer, todo a un mismo tiempo, y dijo que los templos eran campos de batalla, 
donde los viejos acaban, los niños vencen y las mujeres triunfan.</p> 

<p>Picábale una vez una avispa en el cuello, y no se la osaba sacudir por no quebrarse; pero, 
con todo eso, se quejaba. Preguntóle uno que cómo sentía aquella avispa, si era su cuerpo 
de vidrio. Y respondió que aquella avispa debía de ser murmuradora, y que las lenguas y 
picos de los murmuradores eran bastantes a desmoronar cuerpos de bronce, no que de 
vidrio.</p> 

<p>Pasando acaso un religioso muy gordo por donde él estaba, dijo uno de sus oyentes: 
-De hético no se puede mover el padre.</p> 

<p>Enojóse Vidriera, y dijo:</p> 

<p>-Nadie se olvide de lo que dice el Espíritu Santo: Nolite tangere christos meos.</p>
 
<p>Y, subiéndose más en cólera, dijo que mirasen en ello, y verían que de muchos santos que 
de pocos años a esta parte había canonizado la Iglesia y puesto en el número de los 
bienaventurados, ninguno se llamaba el capitán don Fulano, ni el secretario don Tal de don 
Tales, ni el Conde, Marqués o Duque de tal parte, sino fray Diego, fray Jacinto, fray 
Raimundo, todos frailes y religiosos; porque las religiones son los Aranjueces del cielo, 
cuyos frutos, de ordinario, se ponen en la mesa de Dios.</p> 

<p>Decía que las lenguas de los murmuradores eran como las plumas del águila: que roen y 
menoscaban todas las de las otras aves que a ellas se juntan. De los gariteros y tahúres decía 
milagros: decía que los gariteros eran públicos prevaricadores, porque, en sacando el barato 
del que iba haciendo suertes, deseaban que perdiese y pasase el naipe adelante, porque el 
contrario las hiciese y él cobrase sus derechos. Alababa mucho la paciencia de un tahúr, 
que estaba toda una noche jugando y perdiendo, y con ser de condición colérico y 
endemoniado, a trueco de que su contrario no se alzase, no descosía la boca, y sufría lo que 
un mártir de Barrabás. Alababa también las conciencias de algunos honrados gariteros que 
ni por imaginación consentían que en su casa se jugase otros juegos que polla y cientos; y 
con esto, a fuego lento, sin temor y nota de malsines, sacaban al cabo del mes más barato 
que los que consentían los juegos de estocada, del reparolo, siete y llevar, y pinta en la del 
pu[n]to.</p> 

<p>En resolución, él decía tales cosas que, si no fuera por los grandes gritos que daba cuando 
le tocaban o a él se arrimaban, por el hábito que traía, por la estrecheza de su comida, por el 
modo con que bebía, por el no querer dormir sino al cielo abierto en el verano y el invierno 
en los pajares, como queda dicho, con que daba tan claras señales de su locura, ninguno 
pudiera creer sino que era uno de los más cuerdos del mundo.</p> 

<p>Dos años o poco más duró en esta enfermedad, porque un religioso de la Orden de San 
Jerónimo, que tenía gracia y ciencia particular en hacer que los mudos entendiesen y en 
cierta manera hablasen, y en curar locos, tomó a su cargo de curar a Vidriera, movido de 
caridad; y le curó y sanó, y volvió a su primer juicio, entendimiento y discurso. Y, así como 
le vio sano, le vistió como letrado y le hizo volver a la Corte, adonde, con dar tantas 
muestras de cuerdo como las había dado de loco, podía usar su oficio y hacerse famoso por 
él.</p> 

<p>Hízolo así; y, llamándose el licenciado Rueda, y no Rodaja, volvió a la Corte, donde, 
apenas hubo entrado, cuando fue conocido de los muchachos; mas, como le vieron en tan 
diferente hábito del que solía, no le osaron dar grita ni hacer preguntas; pero seguíanle y 
decían unos a otros:</p> 

<p>-¿Éste no es el loco Vidriera? ¡A fe que es él! Ya viene cuerdo. Pero tan bien puede ser loco 
bien vestido como mal vestido; preguntémosle algo, y salgamos desta confusión.</p> 

<p>Todo esto oía el licenciado y callaba, y iba más confuso y más corrido que cuando estaba 
sin juicio.</p> 

<p>Pasó el conocimiento de los muchachos a los hombres; y, antes que el licenciado llegase al 
patio de los Consejos, llevaba tras de sí más de docientas personas de todas suertes. Con 
este acompañamiento, que era más que de un catedrático, llegó al patio, donde le acabaron 
de circundar cuantos en él estaban. Él, viéndose con tanta turba a la redonda, alzó la voz y 
dijo:</p> 

<p>-Señores, yo soy el licenciado Vidriera, pero no el que solía: soy ahora el licenciado Rueda; 
sucesos y desgracias que acontecen en el mundo, por permisión del cielo, me quitaron el 
juicio, y las misericordias de Dios me le han vuelto. Por las cosas que dicen que dije 
cuando loco, podéis considerar las que diré y haré cuando cuerdo. Yo soy graduado en 
leyes por Salamanca, adonde estudié con pobreza y adonde llevé segundo en licencias: de 
do se puede inferir que más la virtud que el favor me dio el grado que tengo. Aquí he 
venido a este gran mar de la Corte para abogar y ganar la vida; pero si no me dejáis, habré 
venido a bogar y granjear la muerte. Por amor de Dios que no hagáis que el seguirme sea 
perseguirme, y que lo que alcancé por loco, que es el sustento, lo pierda por cuerdo. Lo que 
solíades preguntarme en las plazas, preguntádmelo ahora en mi casa, y veréis que el que os 
respon-día bien, según dicen, de improviso, os responderá mejor de pensado.</p> 

<p>Escucháronle todos y dejáronle algunos. Volvióse a su posada con poco menos 
acompañamiento que había llevado.</p>
 
<p>Salió otro día y fue lo mismo; hizo otro sermón y no sirvió de nada. Perdía mucho y no 
ganaba cosa; y, viéndose morir de hambre, determinó de dejar la Corte y volverse a 
Flandes, donde pensaba valerse de las fuerzas de su brazo, pues no se podía valer de las de 
su ingenio.</p> 

<p>Y, poniéndolo en efeto, dijo al salir de la Corte:</p> 

<p>-¡Oh Corte, que alargas las esperanzas de los atrevidos pretendientes, y acortas las de los 
virtuosos encogidos, sustentas abundantemente a los truhanes desvergonzados y matas de 
hambre a los discretos vergonzosos!</p> 

<p>Esto dijo y se fue a Flandes, donde la vida que había comenzado a eternizar por las letras la 
acabó de eternizar por las armas, en compañía de su buen amigo el capitán Valdivia, 
dejando fama en su muerte de prudente y valentísimo soldado.</p>
