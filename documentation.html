		<h1>Components of the Saber Callar Literary e-Journal</h1>
		<div class="dropcap">
		<p>The <i>Saber Callar</i> literary e-journal is composed of:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>5 primary HTML files: “index.html”, “borges.html”, “cervantes.html”, “documentation.html”, and “editor.html”.</li>
			<li>6 HTML files for the 6 short stories, marked-up with metadata categories, which are loaded for display into the “borges.html” and “cervantes.html” pages.</li>
			<li>1 Javascript file containing all the functions which permit <i>Saber Callar</i>’s responsivity. These include functions for toggling between English, Spanish, and bilingual versions of the texts; functions for swapping the CSS style and for storing the current style in local storage for site continuity during reader browsing; a function to scroll to the top of the page; and functions producing Javascript alerts (for the ‘edition coming soon’ and disclaimer messages). Note: additional Javascript functions which permit the functionality of the metadata toolbar on the “borges.html” and “cervantes.html” pages are incorporated into the bottom of these HTML pages.</li>
			<li>2 CSS files: “VogueCSS.css” and “MondrianCSS.css”. These contain the style specifications which enable the site to be displayed in the typographical and layout styles of Vogue Magazine and the artwork <i> Composition II with Red, Blue and Yellow</i> by Piet Mondrian (see below for further information on <i>Saber Callar</i>’s style inspirations).
			<li> 30 images files.</li>
			<li> 3 TrueType/OpenType files for customised fonts.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>All of these files can be accessed via the <i>Saber Callar</i> <a href="https://github.com/SaberCallar/2022">GitHub page</a>.</p>

		<h1>Workflow of the Saber Callar Literary e-Journal</h1>
		<div class="dropcap">
		<p>The first step in the creation of <i>Saber Callar</i> was to spend preparatory time working on the e-journal’s chosen texts. This included marking up the texts in HTML for display on the Web, as well as marking up each instance of the metadata categories. These were: references to characters, references to places, and important quotations. These categories were chosen for their applicability across all types of fictional literary creations, and for the insights into the texts which can come about through an extraction and analysis of such information (for example, the frequency of references to a particular character or the prevalence of a particular location).</p>
		<p>The next step in the creation of the e-journal was to create a skeleton, style-free, HTML structure of the site. Although Bootstrap was used to create this skeleton structure, it was decided not to use a pre-designed Bootstrap template, maximising control, oversight, and understanding of the site’s design. The most complicated part of this process was the creation of the “borges.html” and “cervantes.html” pages, which was greatly aided by the template provided by Professor Fabio Vitali during the course of his <i>Information Modelling and Web Technologies</i> classes at the University of Bologna, 2021-22.</p>
		<p>Having established the core structure and Javascript functionality of the site, the final step in the creation of <i>Saber Callar</i> was to construct the CSS style sheets (and corresponding Javascript functions) which would successfully and faithfully mirror the chosen typographical and layout styles (explained further below).</p>

		<p>The Vogue CSS style is inspired by Vogue Magazine, one of the most famous magazines in the world. Vogue is an authoritative source of information on matters concerning fashion and lifestyle and its typography and layout reflects this authoritative status. Key adjectives to describe this style include: sleek, modern, serious, and sophisticated.</p>
		<p>The instantly recognisable Vogue logo is written in a Didone font – a group of fonts created by Firmin Didot in the late 18th century which went on to become the standard fonts for general purpose printing in the 19th century. These are characterised by the use of serifs, the contrast between thin and thick lines in letters, and an unornamented appearance. In contrast to old-face designs dating from the Renaissance, Didone fonts are characterised as modern.</p>
		<p>This style was chosen as one of the possible styles of <i>Saber Callar</i> due to the complementarity between Vogue Magazine’s understated authoritativeness and the showcasing of concise and understated literary creations that <i>Saber Callar</i> aims to carry out.</p>
		<p>We see this inspiration throughout <i>Saber Callar</i> through the use of the Didone font for logos, headings, and drop caps; the use of a clean, easily-readable font (Garamond) for text sections; the simple, unadorned style of the site’s pages; as well as the choice to limit the colour palette of the site to black and white – although Vogue does of course use colour, some of its most signature-style spreads do not, shown in the pictures above. All of these style choices encapsulate the reputation of Vogue Magazine and the spirit of <i>Saber Callar</i>.</p>

		<p>The Mondrian CSS style is inspired by the artwork <i>Composition II with Red, Blue and Yellow</i>, created by the Dutch artist Piet Mondrian in 1930. Mondrian was one of the greatest artists of the 20th century, pioneering the transition from figurative painting to abstract art. Mondrian urgently sought the expression of aesthetic and universal ideals, so much so, that his artistic “language” eventually narrowed to simple geometric shapes and three primary colours.</p>
		<p>In 1965, French fashion designer, Yves Saint Laurent, further diffused Mondrian’s work when he designed the <i>Mondrian Collection</i> - a series of carefully crafted shift dresses designed as an ode to the Dutch painter. Both the painting and the dresses are deceptively simple: Mondrian’s artistic style was honed over decades to express precisely his universal aspirations, and Saint Laurent’s constructively complex dress is in fact the work of a master sewer and dressmaker.</p>
		<p>This style was chosen as one of the possible styles of <i>Saber Callar</i> in order to extend the relationship that Saint Laurent forged between fine art and fashion to incorporate another art form too: the short story. Concise and deceptively simple, short stories also conceal artistic mastery and conceptual subtlety.</p>
		<p>We see this inspiration throughout <i>Saber Callar</i> through the use of geometric structural components, delineated by thick black lines; the use of a colour scheme limited to three primary colours, red, blue, and yellow, alongside careful use of whitespace; and the use of fonts for logos and headers (Jigsaw) and for text sections (Hurtmold) that demonstrate the spirit of chunky linear lines and geometric shapes. All of these style choices encapsulate the deceptive simplicity of Mondrian and Saint Laurent’s work and the deceptive simplicity of the short story genre.</p>
